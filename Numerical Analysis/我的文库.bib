  abstract = {A novel on-chip extreme subwavelength ``acoustic antenna'' whose radiation efficiency is {$\approx$}50 times larger than the theoretical limit for a resonantly driven antenna is demonstrated. The antenna is composed of magnetostrictive nanomagnets deposited on a piezoelectric substrate. The nanomagnets are partially in contact with a heavy metal (Pt) nanostrip. Passage of alternating current through the nanostrip exerts alternating spin\textendash orbit torque on the nanomagnets and periodically rotates their magnetizations. During the rotation, the magnetostrictive nanomagnets expand and contract, thereby setting up alternating tensile and compressive strain in the piezoelectric substrate underneath. This leads to the generation of a surface acoustic wave in the substrate and makes the nanomagnet assembly act as an acoustic antenna. The measured radiation efficiency of this acoustic antenna at the detected frequency is {$\approx$}1\%, while the wavelength to antenna dimension ratio is {$\approx$}67:1. For a standard antenna driven at acoustic resonance, the efficiency would have been limited to {$\approx$}(1/67)2 = 0.02\%. It became possible to beat that limit (by {$\approx$}50 times) via actuating the antenna not at acoustic resonance, but by using a completely different mechanism involving spin\textendash orbit torque originating from the giant spin Hall effect in Pt.},

  abstract = {Recent studies have garnered considerable interest in the field of propulsion to maneuver micro- and nanosized objects. Acoustics provide an alternate and attractive method to generate propulsion. To date, most acoustic-based swimmers do not use structural resonances, and their motion is determined by a combination of bulk acoustic streaming and a standing-wave field. The resultant field is intrinsically dependent on the boundaries of their resonating chambers. Though acoustic based propulsion is appealing in biological contexts, existing swimmers are less efficient, especially when operating in vivo, since no predictable standing-wave can be established in a human body. Here we describe a new class of nanoswimmer propelled by the small-amplitude oscillation of a flagellum-like flexible tail in standing and, more importantly, in traveling acoustic waves. The artificial nanoswimmer, fabricated by multistep electrodeposition techniques, compromises a rigid bimetallic head and a flexible tail. During acoustic excitation of the nanoswimmer the tail structure oscillates, which leads to a large amplitude propulsion in traveling waves. FEM simulation results show that the structural resonances lead to high propulsive forces.},

  abstract = {Programmable soft materials exhibiting dynamically reconfigurable, reversible, fast, and latchable shape transformation are key for applications ranging from wearable tactile actuators to deployable soft robots. Multimorph soft actuator sheets with high load-bearing capacity are reported, capable of bending on multiple axis, made by combining a single dielectric elastomer actuator (DEA) with two layers of shape memory polymers (SMPs) fibers and an array of stretchable heaters. The rigidity of the SMP fibers can be reduced by two orders of magnitude by Joule heating, thus allowing the orientation and location of soft and hard regions to be dynamically defined by addressing the heaters. When the DEA is then actuated, it bends preferentially along the soft axis, enabling the device to morph into multiple distinct configurations. Cooling down the SMPs locks these shape changes into place. A tip deflection angle of over 300\textdegree{} at 5 kV is achieved with a blocking force of over 27 mN. Devices using two antagonistic DEAs are also reported that attain more complex shapes. Multimorphing is demonstrated by gripping objects with different shapes. An analytical model is developed to determine the design parameters that offers the best trade-off between large actuation and high holding forces.},

  abstract = {Soft electronics are a promising and revolutionary alternative for traditional electronics when safe physical interaction between machines and the human body is required. Among various materials architectures developed for producing soft and stretchable electronics, Liquid-Metal Embedded Elastomers (LMEEs), which contain Ga-based inclusions as a conductive phase, has drawn considerable attention in various emerging fields such as wearable computing and bio-inspired robotics. This is because LMEEs exhibit a unique combination of desirable mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties. For instance, these so-called multifunctional materials can undergo large deformations as high as 600\% strain without losing their electrical conductivity. Moreover, the desperation of conductive liquid-metal inclusions within the entire medium of an elastomer makes it possible to fabricate autonomously self-healing circuits that maintain their electrical functionality after extreme mechanical damage induction. The electrically self-healing property is of great importance for further progress in autonomous soft robotics, where materials are subjected to various modes of mechanical damage such as tearing. In this short review, we review the fundamental characteristics of LMEEs, their advantages over other conductive composites, materials used in LMMEs, their preparation and activation process, and the fabrication process of self-healing circuits. Additionally, we will review the soft-lithography-enabled techniques for liquid-metal pattering.},

  abstract = {Dielectric elastomer (DE) actuators are popularly referred to as artificial muscles because their impressive actuation strain and speed, low density, compliant nature, and silent operation capture many of the desirable physical properties of muscle. Unlike conventional robots and machines, whose mechanisms and drive systems rapidly become very complex as the number of degrees of freedom increases, groups of DE artificial muscles have the potential to generate rich motions combining many translational and rotational degrees of freedom. These artificial muscle systems can mimic the agonist-antagonist approach found in nature, so that active expansion of one artificial muscle is taken up by passive contraction in the other. They can also vary their stiffness. In addition, they have the ability to produce electricity from movement. But departing from the high stiffness paradigm of electromagnetic motors and gearboxes leads to new control challenges, and for soft machines to be truly dexterous like their biological analogues, they need precise control. Humans control their limbs using sensory feedback from strain sensitive cells embedded in muscle. In DE actuators, deformation is inextricably linked to changes in electrical parameters that include capacitance and resistance, so the state of strain can be inferred by sensing these changes, enabling the closed loop control that is critical for a soft machine. But the increased information processing required for a soft machine can impose a substantial burden on a central controller. The natural solution is to distribute control within the mechanism itself. The octopus arm is an example of a soft actuator with a virtually infinite number of degrees of freedom (DOF). The arm utilizes neural ganglia to process sensory data at the local ``arm'' level and perform complex tasks. Recent advances in soft electronics such as the piezoresistive dielectric elastomer switch (DES) have the potential to be fully integrated with actuators and sensors. With the DE switch, we can produce logic gates, oscillators, and a memory element, the building blocks for a soft computer, thus bringing us closer to emulating smart living structures like the octopus arm. The goal of future research is to develop fully soft machines that exploit smart actuation networks to gain capabilities formerly reserved to nature, and open new vistas in mechanical engineering.},

The force and displacement generated by such actuators have been studied as a function of applied electric field under different prestrained conditions. In order to introduce anisotropy in the fiber behavior, two types of prestrains (uniaxial and uniform) were applied. Actuation strains of 7 and 18\% were recorded for silicone tubes in the axial and radial directions, respectively. Polyurethane tubes produced significantly higher blocking force compared to silicone tubes. The results demonstrate significant influence of applied prestrain on actuation strains and blocking force measured under isometric condition.},

Fluid flow in the liquid electrodes can enhance mass transfer and reduce the formation of localized intermetallics, and fluid flow can be promoted by careful choice of the locations and topology of a battery's electrical connections. In this context we study four phenomena that drive flow: Rayleigh-B\textbackslash 'enard convection, internally heated convection, electro-vortex flow, and swirl flow, in both experiment and simulation. In experiments, we use ultrasound Doppler velocimetry (UDV) to measure the flow in a eutectic PbBi electrode at 160\{\textbackslash deg\}C and subject to all four phenomena. In numerical simulations, we isolate the phenomena and simulate each separately using OpenFOAM. Comparing simulated velocities to experiments via a UDV beam model, we find that all four phenomena can enhance mass transfer in LMBs. We explain the flow direction, describe how the phenomena interact, and propose dimensionless numbers for estimating their mutual relevance. A brief discussion of electrical connections summarizes the engineering implications of our work.},

  abstract = {Neural machine translation is a recently proposed approach to machine translation. Unlike the traditional statistical machine translation, the neural machine translation aims at building a single neural network that can be jointly tuned to maximize the translation performance. The models proposed recently for neural machine translation often belong to a family of encoder\textendash decoders and encode a source sentence into a fixed-length vector from which a decoder generates a translation. In this paper, we conjecture that the use of a fixed-length vector is a bottleneck in improving the performance of this basic encoder\textendash decoder architecture, and propose to extend this by allowing a model to automatically (soft-)search for parts of a source sentence that are relevant to predicting a target word, without having to form these parts as a hard segment explicitly. With this new approach, we achieve a translation performance comparable to the existing state-of-the-art phrase-based system on the task of English-to-French translation. Furthermore, qualitative analysis reveals that the (soft-)alignments found by the model agree well with our intuition.},

However, the easy fabrication of these devices and the corresponding shape memory materials is still a challenge. Herein, we synthesized a series of novel NIR-induced shape memory ionomers with multistage responsiveness using commercialized polymers as the framework and various metal ions as cross-linked junctions, which exhibit a high shape recovery ratio of over 93\%. The light-induced shape memory properties of the ionomer can be freely tailored by merely adjusting the species and content of metal ions due to the specific photothermal effect of each ion. Moreover, the dynamic ionic cross-linked interaction also causes light-induced plasticity, leading to repeatable programming of these ionomers to new permanent shapes without sacrificing their shape memory properties. The combination of these ionomers containing different bridge ions is able to achieve light-induced multistage shape modulation, which was further used to fabricate several devices, such as light-operated actuators and switches, demonstrating their versatile application potential in various fields.},

Several models have been developed by others to describe the solid-liquid separation process in the SBC and to predict the separation efficiency (solids re\- covery). These models cannot, however, provide detailed information on particle size classification in the SBC, mainly resulting from the neglect of the liquid backflow (in the direction away from effluent discharge point) near the sediments within the SBC and the disregard for different drag regimes. The present work addresses these issues. A physical model without any adjustable parameters was developed to predict solid-liquid separation and particle size classification in the SBC. The model predictions are in good agreement with published experimental data.},

The present PM under consideration has a payload capacity of 25 kgf. The grippers used are subjected to higher grip forces than the payloads as they have to use the friction forces to hold. The grippers are designed to have links translating the forces from the motors present above the wrist. If the links are not properly connected and positioned, the performance of the gripper will be affected very badly reflecting a very low payload capacity.},

However, three-dimensional (3D) droplet operations, including droplet bouncing, have mostly been limited to nonmetallic liquids or aqueous solutions. This is the first study of liquid metal droplet bouncing using continuous AC electrowetting through an analytical model, computational fluid dynamics simulation, and empirical validation to the best of our knowledge. We achieved liquid metal droplet bouncing with a height greater than 5 mm with an actuation voltage of less than 10 V and a frequency of less than 5 Hz. We compared the bouncing trajectories of the liquid metal droplet for different actuation parameters. We found that the jumping height of the droplet increases as the frequency of the applied AC voltage decreases and its amplitude increases until the onset of instability. Furthermore, we model the attenuation dynamics of consecutive bouncing cycles of the underdamped droplet bouncing system. This study embarks on controlling liquid metal droplet bouncing electrically, thereby opening a plethora of new opportunities utilizing 3D liquid metal droplet operations for numerous applications such as energy harvesting, heat transfer, and radio frequency (RF) switching.},

  abstract = {This paper presents an algorithm for the automatic inspection of leadframes to detect stamping defects in the presence of translational and rotational misalignment. The algorithm uses several image processing operations such as blob analysis, morphological closing and image subtraction to detect the stamping defects. The algorithm has been successfully tested on leadframes having simulated and real defects on multiple modules. The proposed algorithm overcomes both translational and rotational misalignment of the leadframe, thus eliminating the need to synchronize the leadframe movement and camera image capture. The system can be integrated in the manufacturing line for inspecting both continuous reel and individual cut leadframes.},

  abstract = {Shape memory composites are fascinating materials with the ability to preserve deformed shapes that recover when triggered by certain external stimuli. Although elastomers are not inherently shape memory materials, the inclusion of phase-change materials within the elastomer can impart shape memory properties. When this filler changes the phase from liquid to solid, the effective modulus of the polymer increases significantly, enabling stiffness tuning. Using gallium, a metal with a low melting point (29.8 \textdegree C), it is possible to create elastomeric materials with metallic conductivity and shape memory properties. This concept has been used previously in core-shell (gallium-elastomer) fibers and foams, but here, we show that it can also be implemented in elastomeric films containing microchannels. Such microchannels are appealing because it is possible to control the geometry of the filler and create metallically conductive circuits. Stretching the solidified metal fractures the fillers; however, they can heal by body heat to restore conductivity. Such conductive, shape memory sheets with healable conductivity may find applications in stretchable electronics and soft robotics.},

  abstract = {Traditional electronic devices are composed of rigid materials and components that tend to be unsuitable for soft robotic and stretchable electronic applications, such as wearable or continuous pressure sensing. However, deformable materials have the potential to improve upon traditional devices through enhanced sensitivity and responsiveness, better conformability and biocompatibility at the human-machine interface, and greater durability. This work presents deformable composite materials composed of the gallium-indium-tin alloy galinstan (GaInSn) that combines the conductivity of a metal and the intrinsic deformability of a liquid. Dispersing galinstan in an elastomer allows for the formation of deformable dielectric materials that have tunable mechanical and electrical behavior, for example, modulus and relative permittivity. Galinstan composites have been shown previously to have a minimal modulus impact on the elastomer but concurrently achieve impressive dielectric performance. However, galinstan dispersions can be costly and face challenges of mechanical and electrical reliability. Thereby, this work investigates multimaterial composites composed of galinstan and a rigid filler, either iron or barium titanate, with respect to morphology, mechanical behavior, dielectric behavior, and pressure sensing performance for the purpose of achieving a balance between a low modulus and superior electrical performance. By combining galinstan and rigid fillers, it was found that the mechanical and electrical properties, such as modulus, permittivity, loss behavior, sensitivity, and linearity of the multimaterial composites can be improved by tuning filler formulation. This suggests that these dielectric materials can be used for sensing applications that can be precisely calibrated to specific material properties and the needs of the user. These deformable multimaterial composites, found to be stretchable and highly responsive in sensing applications, will expand the current mechanical abilities of deformable dielectric materials to improve soft robotic and stretchable electronic devices.},

  abstract = {Owing to the perfect combination of metallic conductivity, liquid fluidity, and mechanical stability, liquid metals (LMs) are considered the potential materials of the electromechanical system and the basic components of liquid robot. Here, triboelectric effect-driven liquid metal actuators (TLMAs) have been demonstrated, in which the motions of LMs could be driven and accurately controlled by triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs). By the coulomb forces of transferred triboelectric charges in interdigital electrodes and inertia effects, the LM could be driven for continuous linear and circular motions, respectively. As an alternative structure, the motion of LMs could also be accurately controlled, in which the reciprocating and merging of LMs have been demonstrated. Moreover, the TLMA could serve as a control switch to modulate on/off of an LED by integrating into a circuit, and a transport system based on TLMA has also been demonstrated. In this work, the TENG is used as a medium to first drive and accurately control LMs by external mechanical force, which may have great applications in Micro-Electro-Mechanical System (MEMS), liquid robot, and intelligent microcontroller.},

  abstract = {In this work, \textvisiblespace -lactalbumin (\textvisiblespace -la) rich precipitate particles are formed and aged in a batch stirred-tank from a whey protein concentrate (WPC) dispersion. Precipitation of the proteins occurs during a period of acid-addition followed by an ageing period. This study investigates how stirred-tank impeller agitation and subsequent processing, by means of passing precipitate suspensions through a capillary tube or a partially open ball-valve, affect particle size and composition. Precipitate particles are largely unaffected when subjected to laminar capillary tube flow. However, as flow becomes transitional and thereafter turbulent, particle breakage increases, especially for precipitates formed and aged under mild agitation conditions. Precipitates passed through the ball-valve experience even greater particle size reduction as a sharp geometrical transition results in highly turbulent flow. Moreover, particles formed and aged under low shear conditions, though initially larger, are in fact weaker and fragment to a greater extent during turbulent processing through the ball-valve. This has process design implications for separation processes where particle size is important, as shear history can influence particle toughness. Substantial size reduction of particles can best be mitigated by identifying regions of high turbulence or sudden changes in flow geometry, and by redesigning these regions so as to reduce these effects. \textcopyright{} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Here, by drawing inspiration from a covalent\textendash noncovalent network, an elaborately designed biopolyester is developed that features a simple hygroscopic actuation mechanism, straightforward manufacturability at low ambient temperature ({$\leq$}35 \textdegree C), fast and stable response, robust mechanical properties, and excellent self-healing ability.

  abstract = {Most existing Siamese-based tracking methods execute the classification and regression of the target object based on the similarity maps. However, they either employ a single map from the last convolutional layer which degrades the localization accuracy in complex scenarios or separately use multiple maps for decision making, introducing intractable computations for aerial mobile platforms. Thus, in this work, we propose an efficient and effective hierarchical feature transformer (HiFT) for aerial tracking. Hierarchical similarity maps generated by multi-level convolutional layers are fed into the feature transformer to achieve the interactive fusion of spatial (shallow layers) and semantics cues (deep layers). Consequently, not only the global contextual information can be raised, facilitating the target search, but also our end-to-end architecture with the transformer can efficiently learn the interdependencies among multi-level features, thereby discovering a tracking-tailored feature space with strong discriminability. Comprehensive evaluations on four aerial benchmarks have proven the effectiveness of HiFT. Real-world tests on the aerial platform have strongly validated its practicability with a real-time speed.

However, few studies have paid attention to the influence of magnetic inter-particle forces during transport process on the final particle distribution. To explore this issue, this work constructed a micro-particle sedimentation system dominated by gravity and the magnetic inter-particle force. Meanwhile, a simple and novel electromagnetic dual-coil actuation system was developed to generate multiple types of static and dynamic magnetic fields for comparative analysis. It is found that the particle assembly behavior induced by magnetic inter-particle forces can result in the decrease of coverage ratio or distribution uniformity under frequently-used static magnetic fields. Furthermore, it has been confirmed that the dynamic magnetic fields including alternating and steptype fields can be applied to alter the magnetic inter-particle forces and inhibit magnetic assembly, thereby achieving a wealth of distribution patterns of particles at the bottom of a micro-container.},

Herein, we report a nano-liquid metal (LM)-based highly robust stretchable electrode (NHSE) with a self-adaptable interface that mimics water-to-net interaction. Based on the in situ assembly of electrospun elastic nanofiber scaffolds and electrosprayed LM nanoparticles, the NHSE exhibits an extremely low sheet resistance of 52 m{$\Omega$} sq-1. It is not only insensitive to a large degree of mechanical stretching (i.e., 350\% electrical resistance change upon 570\% elongation) but also immune to cyclic deformation (i.e., 5\% electrical resistance increases after 330 000 stretching cycles with 100\% elongation). These key properties are far superior to those of the state-of-the-art reports. Its robustness and stability are verified under diverse circumstances, including long-term exposure to air (420 days), cyclic submersion (30 000 times), and resilience against mechanical damages. The combination of conductivity, stretchability, and durability makes the NHSE a promising conductor/electrode solution for flexible/stretchable electronics for applications such as wearable on-body physiological signal detection, human\textendash machine interaction, and heating e-skin.},

  abstract = {Electrofreezing is the electrically induced nucleation of ice from supercooled water. This work studies ice nucleation in electrowetted water droplets, wherein there is no electric field inside the droplet resting on a dielectric layer. Instead, there is an interfacial electric field and charge buildup at the solid\textendash liquid interface. This situation is in contrast to most previous electrofreezing studies, which have used bare electrodes, involve current flow, and have a volumetric electric field inside the liquid. Infrared and high-speed visualizations of static water droplets are used to analyze surface electrofreezing. Ultrahigh electric fields of up to 80 V/{$\mu$}m are applied, which is one order of magnitude higher than in previous studies. The results facilitate an in-depth understanding of various mechanisms underlying electrofreezing. First, it is seen that interfacial electric fields alone can significantly elevate freezing temperatures by more than 15 \textdegree C, in the absence of current flow. Second, the magnitude of electrofreezing induced temperature elevation saturates at high electric field strengths. Third, the polarity of the interfacial charge does not significantly influence electrofreezing. Overall, it is seen that electrofreezing nucleation kinetics is primarily influenced by the three-phase boundary and not the solid\textendash liquid interface. Through careful electrofreezing measurements on dielectric layers with pinholes to allow current flow, the individual role of electric fields and electric currents on electrofreezing is isolated. It is seen that both the electric field and the electric current influence electrofreezing; however, the physical mechanisms are very different.},

These proposed standards are intended to have a general scope and a broad applicability to different material types and device configurations. Nevertheless, they also intentionally exclude some aspects where knowledge and/or consensus in the literature were deemed to be insufficient.

Given a low-resolution reference input and output pair, we model the operator by fitting local curves that map the input to the output. We can then produce a full-resolution output by evaluating these low-resolution curves on the full-resolution input. We demonstrate that this faithfully models state-of-the-art operators for tone mapping, style transfer, and recoloring. The curves are computed by lifting the input into a bilateral grid and then solving for the 3D array of affine matrices that best maps input color to output color per x, y, intensity bin. We enforce a smoothness term on the matrices which prevents false edges and noise amplification. We can either globally optimize this energy, or quickly approximate a solution by locally fitting matrices and then enforcing smoothness by blurring in grid space. This latter option reduces to joint bilateral upsampling [Kopf et al. 2007] or the guided filter [He et al. 2013], depending on the choice of parameters. The cost of running the algorithm is reduced to the cost of running the original algorithm at greatly reduced resolution, as fitting the curves takes about 10 ms on mobile devices, and 1-2 ms on desktop CPUs, and evaluating the curves can be done with a simple GPU shader.},

  abstract = {This study investigates the influence of various factors on the ductility of thin metal films on polymer substrates through structural modeling of these polymer-supported metal films using finite element analysis software ABAQUS. The various system parameters include the thickness of the film h, the thickness of the polymer substrate H, the thickness ratio between the film and substrate h/H and the Young's modulus of the substrate Es. The results demonstrate that each parameter influences the ductility of films except the thickness ratio between the film and substrate h/H. Furthermore, an orthogonal experiment is performed to analyze the combined action of the parameters on the ductility of polymer-supported metal films. It can be concluded that the most dominating factor that influences the ductility of films on polymer substrate is the thickness of the thin metal film h, while the Young's modulus of the substrate while Es plays a secondary role.},

However, the spreading and shaping of liquid metal still remain a huge challenge to be solved owing to its large surface tension. Here, an intriguing synergistic oxidation-driven liquid metal fractal phenomenon was discovered and the general mechanisms were interpreted, which provides a new strategy for manipulating liquid metal. Experimental results demonstrate that the liquid metal placed on the graphite plate exhibited fractal characteristics with the addition of hydrogen peroxide. Here, it is of significance that hydrogen peroxide and graphite plates synergistically oxidize liquid metal. In addition, we predicted that liquid metal fractals can also be achieved on other eligible substrates based on the proposed general mechanism, which was confirmed by relevant experiments. Furthermore, the fractal dimensions of liquid metal fractal pattern were obtained and evaluated, distinguishing the synergistic oxidation-driven liquid metal fractals from the voltage-driven liquid metal fractals. Besides, we initially gave the best concentration range in which dendritic fractals can occur in order to guide practice. The ability to achieve liquid metal fractals promises rich opportunities in freely driving the liquid metal for soft machines and manufacturing the shape-reconfigurable electronic circuits.},

A major challenge in the popular tracking-by-detection framework is how to associate unreliable detection results with existing tracks. In this paper, we propose to handle unreliable detection by collecting candidates from outputs of both detection and tracking. The intuition behind generating redundant candidates is that detection and tracks can complement each other in different scenarios. Detection results of high confidence prevent tracking drifts in the long term, and predictions of tracks can handle noisy detection caused by occlusion. In order to apply optimal selection from a considerable amount of candidates in real-time, we present a novel scoring function based on a fully convolutional neural network, that shares most computations on the entire image. Moreover, we adopt a deeply learned appearance representation, which is trained on largescale person re-identification datasets, to improve the identification ability of our tracker. Extensive experiments show that our tracker achieves real-time and state-of-the-art performance on a widely used people tracking benchmark.},

Developing a simple and robust strategy for 3D electronics reconstruction and function extension remains a challenge. Here, we propose a solvent-driven bistable actuator, which acts as a substrate to reconstruct the combined 3D electronic device. Extraction of silicon oil from a hybrid poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) circle sheet buckles the dish to a bistable structure. The ultraviolet (UV)/ozone treatment on one surface of the PDMS structure introduces an oxidized layer, yielding a bilayered, solvent-driven bistable smart actuator. The snap-back stimulus to the oxidized layer differs from the snap-through stimulus. Experimental and numerical studies reveal the fundamental regulations for buckling configurations and the bistable behavior of the actuator. The prepared bistable actuator drives the bonded kirigami polyimide (PI) sheets to diverse 3D structures from the original bending configuration, reversibly. A frequency-reconfigurable electrically small monopole antenna is presented as a demonstration, which paves a way for the applications of this actuator in the field of reconfigurable 3D electronics.},

Unlike rigid substrates, a droplet deposited on a soft substrate deforms the substrate via a combination of the normal component of surface tension and the Laplace pressure, i.e. by capillary force and the action of disjoining pressure. In turn, the capillary and disjoining pressure-induced substrate deformation affects the wetting phenomena on the substrate. In this review, we summarize recent achievements on static and dynamic wetting of soft substrates and provide an outlook to future progress. In static wetting, theoretical, numerical and experimental investigations of capillary and disjoining pressure-induced substrate deformation are introduced, and corresponding effects on contact angle and contact angle hysteresis are discussed. In dynamic wetting, the influence of substrate stiffness on spontaneous wetting, droplet impact dynamics, and other types of forced wetting and dewetting is considered. Finally, other interesting capillarity-controlled phenomena occurring on soft and soft-like substrates are briefly introduced.},

A fiber-based conductive sensor interconnected with hierarchical microhairy architectures, exhibiting remarkable stretchability ({$<$}200\%) and sensitivity for various stimuli (pressure, stretching, and bending), is developed. For distinguishability of multiple gestures, two hierarchical hairy conductive fibers are twisted to fabricate a fiber-type sensor, which monitors distinct waveforms of electrical signals retrieved from pressure, stretching, and bending. This sensor is highly robust under repeated appliances of external stimuli over multiple cyclic tests of various modes ({$<$}2200 cycles for each stimulus). Upon formation of a self-assembled monolayer, it exhibits stable performance even under wet conditions. For practical applications, this sensor can be weaved into a smart glove to demonstrate a pressure and gesture-discernible wearable controller for virtual reality (VR) interface, shedding light on advances in wearable electronics with medical and healthcare functionalities and VR systems.},

  abstract = {Pump it up                            Carbon nanotube yarns can be used as electrochemical actuators because infiltration with ions causes a contraction in length and an expansion in diameter. Either positive or negative ions can cause this effect. Chu               et al.               constructed an all-solid-state muscle that eliminated the need for an electrolyte bath, which may expand the potential for its use in applications. By infiltrating the yarns with charged polymers, the fibers start partially swollen, so the length can increase through the loss of ions. It is thus possible to increase the overall stroke of the muscle. Further, these composite materials show a surprising increase in stroke with scan rate.

Electrochemical carbon nanotube yarn muscles are of special interest because of their relatively high energy conversion efficiencies. However, they are bipolar, meaning that they do not monotonically expand or contract over the available potential range. This limits muscle stroke and work capacity. Here, we describe unipolar stroke carbon nanotube yarn muscles in which muscle stroke changes between extreme potentials are additive and muscle stroke substantially increases with increasing potential scan rate. The normal decrease in stroke with increasing scan rate is overwhelmed by a notable increase in effective ion size. Enhanced muscle strokes, contractile work-per-cycle, contractile power densities, and energy conversion efficiencies are obtained for unipolar muscles.},

The actuator is composed of a pre-stretched silicone film sputtered with a very thin gold film on both sides, working as electrodes. A particular folded geometry, implemented through an innovative fabrication process, allows to exploit the electrostrictive effect and to develop soft actuators suitable in many applications where softness and flexibility are necessary. The manufactured prototypes were developed on the basis of a parametric model that takes into account all geometric parameters and material characteristics.

Gallium (Ga) based liquid metals (GaLMs) are a remarkable family of functional fluidic materials that can actuate electrically for realising electromechanical functions. Such actuators are simple, highly responsive, highly controllable, and reversible, which has led to the creation of useful devices such as reconfigurable antennas, artificial muscles, electrical switches, and soft robots, just to name a few. Herein, this review succinctly and critically summarises recent advances in research on using GaLMs as electromechanical actuators. First, the properties of GaLMs are introduced, and then the methods for their electrical actuation and the applications thereof are discussed. Finally, an outlook is offered, highlighting the research challenges faced by liquid metal electromechanical actuators in order to develop into commercial devices.},

  abstract = {Soft and stretchable sensors have the potential to be incorporated into soft robotics and conformal electronics. Liquid metals represent a promising class of materials for creating these sensors because they can undergo large deformations while retaining electrical continuity. Incorporating liquid metal into hollow elastomeric capillaries results in fibers that can integrate with textiles, comply with complex surfaces, and be mass produced at high speeds. Liquid metal is injected into the core of hollow and extremely stretchable elastomeric fibers and the resulting fibers are intertwined into a helix to fabricate capacitive sensors of torsion, strain, and touch. Twisting or elongating the fibers changes the geometry and, thus, the capacitance between the fibers in a predictable way. These sensors offer a simple mechanism to measure torsion up to 800 rad m-1\textemdash two orders of magnitude higher than current torsion sensors. These intertwined fibers can also sense strain capacitively. In a complementary embodiment, the fibers are injected with different lengths of liquid metal to create sensors capable of distinguishing touch along the length of a small bundle of fibers via self-capacitance. The three capacitive-based modes of sensing described here may enable new sensing applications that employ the unique attributes of stretchable fibers.},

The suspension is composed of magnetic spherical particles of different radius and density immersed in a Newtonian fluid. The particles settle relative to one another under the action of gravity and, when in close proximity, exert on each other magnetic force and torque due to their permanent magnetization. The equations of motion for both translation and rotation of the particles are solved and particle inertia is included in the calculation. The numerical simulations are based on the direct computations of the hydrodynamic and of the magnetic interactions between the rigid particles in the regime of non-zero Stokes number. A detailed study of the relative trajectories of two magnetic particles in a dilute suspension allows us to explore irreversible interactions that lead to particle aggregation and particle migration induced by the breaking of the time reversibility of the creeping flow due to magnetic effects. The calculation shows that the rotation of the particles produced by magnetic interactions change significantly the dynamics of collisions of magnetic particle.},

The enhancement of the sparsity is achieved by grouping similar 2-D image fragments (e.g., blocks) into 3-D data arrays which we call ``groups.'' Collaborative filtering is a special procedure developed to deal with these 3-D groups. We realize it using the three successive steps: 3-D transformation of a group, shrinkage of the transform spectrum, and inverse 3-D transformation. The result is a 3-D estimate that consists of the jointly filtered grouped image blocks. By attenuating the noise, the collaborative filtering reveals even the finest details shared by grouped blocks and, at the same time, it preserves the essential unique features of each individual block. The filtered blocks are then returned to their original positions. Because these blocks are overlapping, for each pixel, we obtain many different estimates which need to be combined. Aggregation is a particular averaging procedure which is exploited to take advantage of this redundancy. A significant improvement is obtained by a specially developed collaborative Wiener filtering. An algorithm based on this novel denoising strategy and its efficient implementation are presented in full detail; an extension to color-image denoising is also developed. The experimental results demonstrate that this computationally scalable algorithm achieves state-of-the-art denoising performance in terms of both peak signal-to-noise ratio and subjective visual quality.},

The hydrodynamic interactions between the suspension and grain particles affect the distribution and transport of particles during suspension flow through porous media. Continuum models based on Darcy's law are widely used to investigate the macroscopic properties of the system. However, these models are unable to capture the pore scale dynamics and microstructure. We have carried out particle migration studies during transport of suspension in heterogeneous porous media using the Stokesian dynamics simulations. The velocity and concentration distributions were first studied in a large scale constant porosity system, but with different concentration of particles in the two adjacent porous layers. It was found that particle migration across the interface is higher when the difference of concentration is large. Simulations were also carried out for constant areal concentration of particles, where the adjacent layers had different porosity. A high rate of migration near the interface was observed for the larger difference in porosity. It was observed that the hydrodynamic interactions are strongly affected by the increase in the number of grain particles of porous media in comparison to that of suspended particles.},

  abstract = {Stretchable electronic devices must conform to curved surfaces and display highly reproducible and predictable performance over a range of mechanical deformations. Mechanical resilience in stretchable devices arises from the inherent robustness and stretchability of each component, as well as from good adhesive contact between functional and structural components. In this work, we combine bench-top thin film structuring with solvent assisted lift-off transfer to produce flexible and stretchable multi-material thin film devices. Patterned wrinkled thin films made of gold (Au), silicon dioxide (SiO2), or indium tin oxide (ITO) were produced through thermal shrinking of pre-stressed polystyrene (PS) substrates. The wrinkled films were then transferred from the PS to poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) substrates through covalent bonding and solvent-assisted dissolution of the PS. Using this approach, different materials and hybrid structures could be lifted off simultaneously from the PS, simplifying the fabrication of multi-material stretchable thin film devices. As proof-of-concept, we used this structuring and transfer method to fabricate flexible and stretchable thin film heaters. Their characterization at a variety of applied voltages and under cyclic tensile strain showed highly reproducible heating performance. We anticipate this fabrication method can aid in the development of flexible and stretchable electronic devices.},

  abstract = {Gallium-based liquid metals are of interest for a variety of applications including flexible electronics, soft robotics, and biomedical devices. Still, nano- to microscale device fabrication with these materials is challenging because, despite having surface tension 10 times higher than water, they strongly adhere to a majority of substrates. This unusually high adhesion is attributed to the formation of a thin oxide shell; however, its role in the adhesion process has not yet been established. In this work, we demonstrate that, dependent on dynamics of formation and resulting morphology of the liquid metal\textendash substrate interface, GaInSn adhesion can occur in two modes. The first mode occurs when the oxide shell is not ruptured as it makes contact with the substrate. Because of the nanoscale topology of the oxide surface, this mode results in minimal adhesion between the liquid metal and most solids, regardless of substrate's surface energy or texture. In the second mode, the formation of the GaInSn\textendash substrate interface involves rupturing of the original oxide skin and formation of a composite interface that includes contact between the substrate and pieces of old oxide, bare liquid metal, and new oxide. We demonstrate that in this latter mode GaInSn adhesion is dominated by the intimate contact between new oxide and substrate. We also show that by varying the pinned contact line length using varied degrees of surface texturing, the adhesion of GaInSn in this mode can be either decreased or increased. Lastly, we demonstrate how these two adhesion modes limit microcontact printing of GaInSn patterns but can be exploited to repeatedly print individual sub-200 nm liquid metal drops.},

The SMC springs can lift up to 87 times their own weight when heated by a Bunsen burner, and the stroke is {$\sim$}3.9 mm. The SMC yarns/springs exhibit an output stress of 14.5\textendash 22.6 MPa, a work density of {$\sim$}15\textendash 20 kJ//m3, and a tensile strength of {$\sim$}100\textendash 200 MPa, which are much higher than those of human muscles and some other polymer-based artificial muscles. Benefiting from the advantages of large output stress, high tensile strength, high actuation temperatures, and fast response, the SMC nanofiber-based yarns/springs have a great potential to be used as artificial muscles at elevated temperatures.},

When the filament is resting on a flat solid surface which imposes wetting conditions the subtle interplay with the fluid dynamics makes the instability pathways and mode selection difficult to predict. Here, we show how controlling the static and dynamic wetting of a surface can lead to repeatable switching between a toroidal film of an electrically insulating liquid and patterns of droplets of well-defined dimensions confined to a ring geometry. Mode selection between instability pathways to these different final states is achieved by dielectrophoresis forces selectively polarising the dipoles at the solid-liquid interface and so changing both the mobility of the contact line and the partial wetting of the topologically distinct liquid domains. Our results provide insights into the wetting and stability of shaped liquid filaments in simple and complex geometries relevant to applications ranging from printing to digital microfluidic devices.},

Experience suggests that dewetting occurs faster on surfaces of higher film repellency. Here, we show how, unexpectedly, a surrounding viscous phase can switch the overall dewetting speed so that films retract slower with increasing surface repellency. We present experiments and a hydrodynamic theory covering five decades of the viscosity ratio between the film and~the surrounding phase. The timescale of dewetting is controlled by the geometry of the liquid-liquid interface close to the contact line and the viscosity ratio. At small viscosity ratio, dewetting is slower on low film-repellency surfaces due to a high dissipation at the edge of the receding film. This situation is reversed at high viscosity ratios, leading to a slower dewetting on high film-repellency surfaces due to the increased dissipation of the advancing surrounding phase.},

In this research, chemically modified magnetic Amberlite XAD-7HP was synthesized using Fe(II) and Fe(III) ions (iron oxide coated Amberlite XAD-7HP) and used for the removal of Cr(III) ions from aqueous solutions. The modified sorbent was characterized using several techniques viz., XRD, SEM, BET, zeta potential, and TGA. The optimum adsorption parameters were investigated in a batch system and evaluated as pH of 6.0, 60.0 min of contact time, 10.0 mg sorbent amount at 25 \textdegree C. It was found that the best kinetic fit of the sorption data was demonstrated by the pseudo-second order model rather than pseudofirst order and intraparticle diffusion models. Moreover, Langmuir, Dubinin\textendash Radushkevich and Freundlich models were also studied to explain the interaction between the sorbate and the sorbent and Langmuir isotherm model was found to be more appropriate for the description of the sorption process. The applicability of the method was tested using real water samples and the results demonstrated the efficiency of the method. The overall results indicated that magnetic iron oxide coated Amberlite XAD-7HP particles offer a great potential for the effective removal of Cr(III) ions from aqueous solutions.},

In this paper we propose a ConvNet architecture that jointly performs detection and tracking, solving the task in a simple and effective way. Our contributions are threefold: (i) we set up a ConvNet architecture for simultaneous detection and tracking, using a multi-task objective for frame-based object detection and across-frame track regression; (ii) we introduce correlation features that represent object co-occurrences across time to aid the ConvNet during tracking; and (iii) we link the frame level detections based on our across-frame tracklets to produce high accuracy detections at the video level. Our ConvNet architecture for spatiotemporal object detection is evaluated on the large-scale ImageNet VID dataset where it achieves state-of-the-art results. Our approach provides better single model performance than the winning method of the last ImageNet challenge while being conceptually much simpler. Finally, we show that by increasing the temporal stride we can dramatically increase the tracker speed.},

While numerous designs have been demonstrated with a variety of conductive elastomers and greases, these materials have significant and often intrinsic shortcomings, e.g. low conductivity, hysteresis, incapability of large deformations, and complex fabrication requirements. The liquid metal alloy eutectic Gallium-Indium (EGaIn) is a promising alternative to existing compliant electrodes, having both high conductivity and complete soft-matter functionality. The liquid electrode shares almost the same electrical conductivity as conventional metal wiring and provides no mechanical resistance to bending or stretching of the DEA. This research establishes a straightforward and effective method for quickly depositing EGaIn electrodes, which can be adapted for batch fabrication, and demonstrates the successful actuation of sample curved cantilever elastomer actuators using these electrodes. As with the vast majority of electrostatically actuated elastomer devices, the voltage requirements for these curved DEAs are still quite significant, though modifications to the fabrication process show some improved electrical properties. The ease and speed with which this method can be implemented suggests that the development of a more electronically efficient device is realistic and worthwhile.},

  abstract = {We introduce a dielectric elastomer actuator (DEA) composed of liquid-phase Gallium-Indium (GaIn) alloy electrodes embedded between layers of poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) and examine its mechanics using a specialized elastic shell theory. Residual stresses in the dielectric and sealing layers of PDMS cause the DEA to deform into a saddle-like geometry (Gaussian curvature K{$<$}0). Applying voltage {$\Phi$} to the liquid metal electrodes induces electrostatic pressure (Maxwell stress) on the dielectric and relieves some of the residual stress. This reduces the longitudinal bending curvature and corresponding angle of deflection \textvartheta. Treating the elastomer as an incompressible, isotropic, NeoHookean solid, we develop a theory based on the principle of minimum potential energy to predict the principal curvatures as a function of {$\Phi$}. Based on this theory, we predict a dependency of \textvartheta{} on {$\Phi$} that is in strong agreement with experimental measurements performed on a GaIn-PDMS composite. By accurately modeling electromechanical coupling in a soft-matter DEA, this theory can inform improvements in design and fabrication.},

We build a new quadruped robot with mechanisms enabling walking to running and apply CPGs modulated by simple vestibular sensory feedback (a body tilt multiplied by a fixed gain). As a result, the robot safely locomotes at a variety of speeds by autonomously changing the gait from walking to trotting to galloping according to speed, despite the fact that the walk and gallop are not preprogrammed. In addition, as this paper's major contribution, we discover and demonstrate that the robot robustly runs with an emergent gallop while stepping on and over several types of unperceived obstacles, while being suddenly pulled forward, and while the physical balance is changed (i.e., a weight is put forward on the robot), by autonomously modifying the phase differences between the four legs from the basic gallop. To our knowledge, no other galloping robots have been reported that can adapt to an unperceived obstacle. We conclude that CPGs modulated by vestibular feedback is effective and practical as a gait generator for bio-inspired robots that are expected to have both the abilities of ``speed-based autonomous gait transition'' and ``autonomous robust running''.},

This paper describes a 3D deep learning nuclei segmentation method using synthetic 3D volumes for training. A set of synthetic volumes and the corresponding groundtruth are generated using spatially constrained cycle-consistent adversarial networks. Segmentation results demonstrate that our proposed method is capable of segmenting nuclei successfully for various data sets.},

  abstract = {Background Conventional approaches of making a flexible circuit are generally complex, environment unfriendly, time and energy consuming, and thus expensive. Here, we describe for the first time the method of using high-performance GaIn10-based electrical ink, a significantly neglected room temperature liquid metal, as both electrical conductors and interconnects, for directly writing flexible electronics via a rather easy going and cost effective way. Methods The new generation electric ink was made and its wettability with various materials was modified to be easily written on a group of either soft or rigid substrates such as epoxy resin board, glass, plastic, silica gel, paper, cotton, textiles, cloth and fiber etc. Conceptual experiments were performed to demonstrate and evaluate the capability of directly writing the electrical circuits via the invented metal ink. Mechanisms involved were interpreted through a series of fundamental measurements. Results The electrical resistivity of the fluid like GaIn10-based material was measured as 34.5 \textmu{$\Omega\cdot$}cm at 297 K by four point probe method and increased with addition of the oxygen quantity, which indicates it as an excellent metal ink. The conductive line can be written with features that are approximately 10 \textmu m thick. Several functional devices such as a light emitting diode (LED) array showing designed lighting patterns and electrical fan were made to work by directly writing the liquid metal on the specific flexible substrates. And satisfactory performances were obtained. Conclusions The present method opens the way to directly and quickly writing flexible electronics which can be as simple as signing a name or drawing a picture on the paper. The unique merit of the GaIn10-based liquid metal ink lies in its low melting temperature, well controlled wettability, high electrical conductivity and good biocompability. The new electronics writing strategy and basic principle has generalized purpose and can be extended to more industrial areas, even daily life.},

Wearable electronic systems require a material that is strong to ensure durability and stability, and a wide range of strain to expand their applications. However, it is still challenging to manufacture fibrous materials with simultaneously high mechanical strength and the tensile property. Herein, the ultra-robust ({$\approx$}17.6 MPa) and extensible ({$\approx$}700\%) conducting microfibers are developed and demonstrated their applications in fabricating fibrous mechanical sensors. The mechanical sensor shows high sensitivity in detecting strains that have high strain resolution and a large detection range (from 0.0075\% to 400\%) simultaneously. Moreover, low frequency vibrations between 0 and 40 Hz are also detected, which covers most tremors that occur in the human body. As a further step, a wearable and smart health-monitoring system has been developed using the fibrous mechanical sensor, which is capable of monitoring health-related physiological signals, including muscle movement, body tremor, wrist pulse, respiration, gesture, and six body postures to predict and diagnose diseases, which will promote the wearable telemedicine technology.},

BGA's remarkable features make this tri-layered actuator a potential candidate for morphing applications.

In this study, various sets of experiments were designed to investigate the effect of several parameters on the maximum lateral displacement of BGA. Two input parameters, voltage and frequency, and three material/design parameters, carbon nanotube type, thickness, and weight fraction of constituents were selected. A new thickness ratio term was also introduced to study the role of individual layers on BGA displacement. A model was established to predict BGA maximum displacement based on the effect of these parameters. This model showed good agreement with reported results from the literature. In addition, an important factor in the design of BGA-based devices, lifetime, was investigated.},

Considering the perfectly balanced features of natural muscular tissue in terms of linear contraction, force-to-weight ratio, scalability and morphology, scientists have been working for many years on mimicking this structure. Focusing on the biomimicry, this review investigates the state-of-the-art of synthetic fibrous, muscle-inspired actuators that, aiming to enhance their mechanical performances, are hierarchically designed from the nanoscale up to the macroscale. In particular, this review focuses on those hierarchical fibrous actuators that enhance their biomimicry employing a linear contraction strategy, closely resembling the skeletal muscles actuation system. The literature analysis shows that bioinspired artificial muscles, developed up to now, only in part comply with skeletal ones. The manipulation and control of the matter at the nanoscale allows to realize ordered structures, such as nanofibers, used as elemental actuators characterized by high strains but moderate force levels. Moreover, it can be foreseen that scaling up the nanostructured materials into micro- and macroscale hierarchical structures, it is possible to realize linear actuators characterized by suitable levels of force and displacement.},

This heightened responsiveness allows the liquid metal to be deformed at rates exceeding 120~mm/s, greater than an order of magnitude faster than existing techniques for electrical deformation. Significantly, it is demonstrated how this process can be combined with voltage-controlled oxide growth on the surface of non-toxic, gallium-based liquid metals to reversibly form and maintain arbitrary, high-energy shapes.},

  abstract = {Detection and characterization of particles in the visible and subvisible size range is critical in many fields of industrial research. Commercial particle analysis systems have proliferated over the last decade. Despite that growth, most systems continue to be based on well-established principles, and only a handful of new approaches have emerged. Identifying the right particle-analysis approach remains a challenge in research and development. The choice depends on each individual application, the sample, and the information the operator needs to obtain. In biopharmaceutical applications, particle analysis decisions must take product safety, product quality, and regulatory requirements into account. Biopharmaceutical process samples and formulations are dynamic, polydisperse, and very susceptible to chemical and physical degradation: improperly handled product can degrade, becoming inactive or in specific cases immunogenic. This article reviews current methods for detecting, analyzing, and characterizing particles in the biopharmaceutical context. The first part of our article represents an overview about current particle detection and characterization principles, which are in part the base of the emerging techniques. It is very important to understand the measuring principle, in order to be adequately able to judge the outcome of the used assay. Typical principles used in all application fields, including particle\textendash light interactions, the Coulter principle, suspended microchannel resonators, sedimentation processes, and further separation principles, are summarized to illustrate their potentials and limitations considering the investigated samples. In the second part, we describe potential technical approaches for biopharmaceutical particle analysis as some promising techniques, such as nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA), micro flow imaging (MFI), tunable resistive pulse sensing (TRPS), flow cytometry, and the space- and time-resolved extinction profile (STEP\textregistered ) technology.},

To this end, we first design the motion blur synthesizing method for visual tracking based on the generation principle of motion blur, considering the motion information and the light accumulation process. With this synthetic method, we propose optimization-based ABA (OP-ABA) by iteratively optimizing an adversarial objective function against the tracking w.r.t. the motion and light accumulation parameters. The OP-ABA is able to produce natural adversarial examples but the iteration can cause heavy time cost, making it unsuitable for attacking realtime trackers. To alleviate this issue, we further propose one-step ABA (OS-ABA) where we design and train a joint adversarial motion and accumulation predictive network (JAMANet) with the guidance of OP-ABA, which is able to efficiently estimate the adversarial motion and accumulation parameters in a one-step way. The experiments on four popular datasets (e.g., OTB100, VOT2018, UAV123, and LaSOT) demonstrate that our methods are able to cause significant accuracy drops on four state-of-the-art trackers with high transferability.

  abstract = {Developing autonomous self-healing materials for applications in harsh conditions is challenging because the reconstruction of interaction in material for self-healing will experience significant resistance and fail. Herein, a universally self-healing and highly stretchable supramolecular elastomer is designed by synergistically incorporating multi-strength H-bonds and disulfide metathesis in polydimethylsiloxane polymers. The resultant elastomer exhibits high stretchability for both unnotched (14000\%) and notched (1300\%) samples. It achieves fast autonomous self-healing under universal conditions, including at room temperature (10\,min for healing), ultralow temperature (-40\,\textdegree C), underwater (93\% healing efficiency), supercooled high-concentrated saltwater (30\% NaCl solution at -10\,\textdegree C, 89\% efficiency), and strong acid/alkali environment (pH = 0 or 14, 88\% or 84\% efficiency). These properties are attributable to synergistic interaction of the dynamic strong and weak H-bonds and stronger disulfide bonds. A self-healing and stretchable conducting device built with the developed elastomer is demonstrated, thereby providing a direction for future e-skin applications.},

Now,                                Haines                 et al.

Twisting high-strength, readily available polymer fibers, such as those used for fishing lines or sewing thread, to the point where they coil up, allowed construction of highly efficient actuators that could be triggered by a number of stimuli.                        ,                             Polymer fibers can be transformed into highly efficient artificial muscles through the application of extreme twist.                                [Also see Perspective by                 Yuan and Poulin                 ]                                       ,              The high cost of powerful, large-stroke, high-stress artificial muscles has combined with performance limitations such as low cycle life, hysteresis, and low efficiency to restrict applications. We demonstrated that inexpensive high-strength polymer fibers used for fishing line and sewing thread can be easily transformed by twist insertion to provide fast, scalable, nonhysteretic, long-life tensile and torsional muscles. Extreme twisting produces coiled muscles that can contract by 49\%, lift loads over 100 times heavier than can human muscle of the same length and weight, and generate 5.3 kilowatts of mechanical work per kilogram of muscle weight, similar to that produced by a jet engine. Woven textiles that change porosity in response to temperature and actuating window shutters that could help conserve energy were also demonstrated. Large-stroke tensile actuation was theoretically and experimentally shown to result from torsional actuation.},

  abstract = {Magnetic biochar was made from peanut hull biomass using iron chloride in a simplified aqueous phase approach and pyrolysis at alternative peak temperatures (450e650  C). Magnetic biochar showed an extreme capacity for adsorption of hexavalent chromium Cr (VI) from aqueous solution, which was 1e2 orders of magnitude higher compared to standard (non-magnetic) biochar from the same feedstock. Adsorption increased with pyrolysis temperature peaking at 77,542 mg kg\`A1 in the sample pyrolysed at 650  C. In contrast to magnetic biochar, the low adsorption capacity of standard biochar decreased with increasing pyrolysis temperature. The fine particle size of magnetic biochar and low aqueous pH were also important for adsorption. Surfaces of products from batch adsorption experiments were characterized by scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray analysis, X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and vibrating sample magnetometer. This revealed that g-Fe2O3 was crucial to the properties (adsorbance and magnetism) of magnetic biochar. The removal mechanism was the Cr (VI) electrostatic attracted on protonated eOH on g-Fe2O3 surface and it could be desorbed by alkaline solution. Findings suggest that pyrolysis has potential to create effective, magnetically recoverable adsorbents relevant to environmental application.},

Despite tremendous progress over the past two decades, current EWOD operating in ambient conditions has limited functionalities posing challenges for its applications, including electronic display, energy generation and microfluidic systems. Here, we demonstrate a new paradigm of electrowetting on liquid-infused film (EWOLF) that allows for complete reversibility and tunable transient response simultaneously. We determine that these functionalities in EWOLF are attributed to its novel configuration, which allows for the formation of viscous liquid-liquid interfaces as well as additional wetting ridges, thereby suppressing the contact line pinning and severe droplet oscillation encountered in the conventional EWOD. Finally, by harnessing these functionalities demonstrated in EWOLF, we also explore its application as liquid lens for fast optical focusing.},

Most existing HSE devices are based on conducting hydrogels that usually have weak mechanical properties, low conductivity, and poor patternability. Reported here is an HSE with good mechanical performance, high sensitivity, and versatile functions by stencil printing of liquid metal on a tough hydrogel, facilitating integration of multiple sensing units. Self-shaping ability is imparted to the HSE by creating gradient structure in the hydrogel substrate. The resultant HSE actively deforms into 3D configurations with zero or nonzero Gaussian curvature to fix on objects or organs with sophisticated geometries and maintains the sensing functions. The versatilities and potential applications of this HSE are demonstrated by monitoring motions of a rice field eel and beatings of a rabbit heart. Such HSE based on morphing substrate should pave the way for implantable electronics with better fixation and interfacial contact with the organs. The concept of morphing hydrogel devices can be extended to other soft electronics with responsive polymer films or elastomers as the substrates.},

However, traditional free standing metallic thin films are often brittle, inextensible, and must be processed in strict environments. This limits implementation into soft technologies where high electrical conductivity must be achieved while maintaining high compliance and conformability. Here we show a liquid metal elastomeric thin film (LET) composite with elastomer-like compliance (modulus {$<$} 500 kPa) and stretchability ({$>$}700\%) with metallic conductivity (sheet resistance {$<$} 0.1 {$\Omega$}/{$\square$}). These 30\textendash 70 \textmu m thin films are highly conformable, free standing, and display a unique Janus microstructure, where a fully conductive activated side is accompanied with an opposite insulated face. LETs display exceptional electro-mechanical characteristics, with a highly linear strain-resistance relationship beyond 700\% deformation while maintaining a low resistance. We demonstrate the multifunctionality of LETs for soft technologies by leveraging the unique combination of high compliance and electrical conductivity with transfer capabilities for strain sensing on soft materials, as compliant electrodes in a dielectric elastomeric actuator, and as resistive heaters for a liquid crystal elastomer.},

One of the most appealing applications of a reflective display is electronic paper, which combines the desirable viewing characteristics of conventional printed paper with the ability to manipulate the displayed information electronically. Electronic paper based on the electrophoretic motion of particles inside small capsules has been demonstrated1 and commercialized; but the response speed of such a system is rather slow, limited by the velocity of the particles. Recently, we have demonstrated that electrowetting is an attractive technology for the rapid manipulation of liquids on a micrometre scale4. Here we show that electrowetting can also be used to form the basis of a reflective display that is significantly faster than electrophoretic displays, so that video content can be displayed. Our display principle utilizes the voltage-controlled movement of a coloured oil film adjacent to a white substrate. The reflectivity and contrast of our system approach those of paper. In addition, we demonstrate a colour concept, which is intrinsically four times brighter than reflective liquid-crystal displays5 and twice as bright as other emerging technologies1,2,3. The principle of microfluidic motion at low voltages is applicable in a wide range of electro-optic devices.},

In this work, we report a muscle-mimetic anisotropic dielectric elastomer fiber with directional output driven by electric field. The millimeter-in-diameter fibers are fabricated by rolling elastomeric ultrathin films of triblock copolymer that are pretreated to generate aligned nanostructures and network strands. We theoretically and experimentally reveal that a moderate orthogonal modulus ratio of radial to axial directions (2.8) leads to highly directional actuation, enhancing linear axial strain by 100\%. Assembling the anisotropic fine fibers into bundles is able to scale up force output and enables variable motion modes such as extension, bend, and rotation.},

  abstract = {磁光双功能纳米材料在药物运输、荧光成像、磁粉检测等领域具有潜在的应用。本文以Fe3O4纳米颗粒为磁性源,以ZnS和稀土元素Eu、Tb的配合物为荧光材料,系统地研究了Fe3O4纳米复合磁光材料的制备与性能,探索了Fe3O4的形貌、粒径大小和荧光材料对复合材料磁学性能和荧光性能的影响,揭示了复合材料在磁粉无损检测中的磁痕显示特征。研究取得如下结果:1)利用化学共沉淀法和水热法分别制备了片状和球形Fe3O4纳米颗粒。研究了球形Fe3O4纳米颗粒的生长过程,分析了水热条件对球形Fe3O4纳米颗粒的尺寸和磁性能的影响。（1）通过研究NaHCO3和Na2CO3诱导制备Fe3O4纳米球体系,发现两者的添加量均显著影响产物的尺寸分布和形貌。0.397mol/L NaHCO3所制备的Fe3O4纳米球颗粒直径分布最宽（122至588 nm）;FeCl3{$\cdot$}6H2O的浓度从0.074mol/L增加至0.222 mol/L,球形颗粒样品转变成尺寸约25 nm表面多孔的多边形小颗粒。延长水热反应时间,产物的结晶性能提高、最大饱和磁化强度增大。（2）发现NaAc{$\cdot$}3H2O诱导制备Fe3O4纳米球体系,当反应物FeCl3{$\cdot$}6H2O的浓度为0.148mol/L时,反应时间从12 h延长至20 h,部分球形Fe3O4纳米颗粒的粒径从700 nm增大至800 nm,符合半径和时间的立方根成正比的基本规律;当反应物FeCl3{$\cdot$}6H2O的浓度为0.018 mol/L时,反应时间从12 h延长至16 h,发现实心Fe3O4纳米球转变成空心球而粒径没有变化。（3）研究了随炉冷却、空气中冷却、冰水中冷却三种不同的冷却方式对球形Fe3O4纳米颗粒的结构、粒径大小以及磁性能的影响,发现冷却速率影响Ostwald熟化过程中的小球溶解,进而影响大球的生长。在三种冷却方式中,发现冰水冷却得到的球形颗粒直径最小,球形颗粒最为致密,最大饱和磁化强度可以达到99.03 emu/g,而随炉冷却得到的球形Fe3O4纳米颗粒粒径最大,最大饱和磁化强度为82.62 emu/g。2)成功合成出Fe3O4@ZnS核-壳纳米球。发现通过改变硫代乙酰胺（TAA）的添加量不仅可以调节核-壳纳米球的尺寸,而且可以调控核-壳纳米球的磁学性能和荧光强度。随着TAA的浓度从0.044 mol/L增加到0.089 mol/L,核-壳纳米球的直径从590 nm增大到690 nm,荧光强度逐渐增强,S空位跃迁使得样品最强发射峰位于358 nm（激发波长225 nm）,非磁性相ZnS量的增加使得复合材料的最大饱和磁化强度从61.66 emu/g降至58.85 emu/g。3)通过稀土元素Eu和Tb掺杂分别制备出红光和青绿光荧光发射的Fe3O4@Eu（DBM）3Phen和Fe3O4@Tb（DBM）3Phen两种磁光双功能复合材料。发现随着稀土掺杂浓度的增加,复合材料的发光强度增强而最大饱和磁化强度分别降低至7.93 emu/g和15.6 emu/g。在395 nm紫外光激发下,Fe3O4@Eu（DBM）3Phen复合材料在618 nm处出现红色发射峰,在365 nm紫外光激发下,Fe3O4@Tb（DBM）3Phen复合材料在514和537 nm处出现两个绿色特征发光峰,在431 nm处出现了蓝色光发射峰。4)采用两步化学方法制备出片状Fe3O4/ZnS磁光双功能复合材料,研究了Co掺杂对复合材料磁光双功能性能的影响。发现引入非磁性相ZnS发光材料,Fe3O4/ZnS复合材料的最大饱和磁化强度显著降低,而Co掺杂可以显著提高复合材料的饱和磁化强度,Co掺杂Fe3O4/ZnS复合材料最强发射峰位于477 nm。5)研究了Fe3O4纳米颗粒的磁痕显示特征。比较了纳米磁悬液和常规磁悬液对人工裂纹缺陷磁痕显示特征,发现纳米磁悬液比常规磁悬液具有更清晰和更长的磁痕显示。人工裂纹缺陷试块的涂覆层厚度和Fe3O4颗粒形貌影响缺陷的磁痕显示,发现当撤走外加磁场后,片状Fe3O4纳米颗粒比球形Fe3O4纳米颗粒磁悬液具有更清晰的磁痕显示。Fe3O4@Eu（DBM）3Phen复合材料也具有优异的缺陷磁痕显示特性。},

  abstract = {In this paper, the effect of encapsulation on deformation behavior and failure mechanisms of stretchable interconnects is presented. Extensive numerical modeling is conducted for mechanical analysis of which the results are correlated with in-situ experimental observations. The numerical results reveal that by adding an encapsulation layer of various thickness (from 0.0 to 0.5 mm) on top of the stretchable interconnect, the outof-plane deformation and in-plane geometrical opening are reduced. Consequently, not only the plastic strain in the metal increases but also the in-plane shear stress at the interconnect/substrate interface. In-situ electromechanical experiments combined with scanning electron micrographs and optical images confirm the numerical analysis. More specifically, it is found that two failure mechanisms are involved during the stretching process: interfacial delamination in a S-shape alongside the metal conductor and metal breakdown at the crests of the metal conductor. The encapsulated stretchable interconnect shows both failure mechanisms at a lower percentage elongation than the non-encapsulated stretchable interconnect. Even so, the onset point of interfacial delamination for the encapsulated stretchable interconnect occurs only at an impressive number of 63\% elongation and metal rupture only at 120\%. The in-plane shear strain contour, obtained by numerical simulation, agrees well with the delamination failure location observed in the experiment.},

The influence of varying electric field intensity and Al content on the LM-Al transformations was also evaluated; the LM-Al droplets displayed specific and distinct behaviors according to each experimental configuration; this further proved the feasibility of using electric fields for controlling LM-Al transformations.

Here, a combination of inverse modeling and laser backscattering is used to determine the PSD for polymer beads typical of operations for a suspension polymerization reactor. Several methods are compared for accurately determining the PSD from the reported chord length distribution (CLD), including methods that take surface roughness into account.

Owing to the good photothermal effect of black phosphorus heterostructure and thermal deformation of the actuator components, the new actuator assembled by heterostructured black phosphorus, polymer and paper produces light-driven reversible deformation with fast and large response. By using this actuator as mechanical power and designing a robot configuration with self-feedback loop to generate self-oscillation, an inchwormlike actuator that can crawl autonomously towards the light source is constructed. Moreover, due to the anisotropy and tailorability of the actuator, an artificial crab robot that can simulate the sideways locomotion of crabs and simultaneously change color under light irradiation is also realized.},

So far, most of the currently available artificial machines are still hard to achieve the complicated amoeba-like behaviors including stretching pseudopodia. Here through introducing a multi-materials system, we discovered a group of very unusual biomimetic amoeba-like behaviors of self-fueled liquid gallium alloy on the graphite surface immersed in alkaline solution. The underlying mechanisms were discovered to be the surface tension variations across the liquid metal droplet through its simultaneous electrochemical interactions with aluminum and graphite in the NaOH electrolyte. This finding would shed light on the packing and the structural design of future soft robots owning diverse deformation capability. Moreover, this study related the physical transformation of a non-living LM droplet to the life behavior of amoeba in nature, which is inspiring in human's pursuit of advanced biomimetic machine.},

Aaron Courville is Assistant Professor of Computer Science at the Universit\'e de Montr\'eal. 内容简介: "Written by three experts in the field, Deep Learning is the only comprehensive book on the subject." -- Elon Musk, co-chair of OpenAI; co-founder and CEO of Tesla and SpaceX Deep learning is a form of machine learning that enables computers to learn from experience and understand the world in terms of a hierarchy of concepts. Because the computer gathers knowledge from experience, there is no need for a human computer operator to formally specify all the knowledge that the computer needs. The hierarchy of concepts allows the computer to learn complicated concepts by building them out of simpler ones; a graph of these hierarchies would be many layers deep. This book introduces a broad range of topics in deep learning. The text offers mathematical and conceptual background, covering relevant concepts in linear algebra, probability theory and information theory, numerical computation, and machine learning. It describes deep learning techniques used by practitioners in industry, including deep feedforward networks, regularization, optimization algorithms, convolutional networks, sequence modeling, and practical methodology; and it surveys such applications as natural language processing, speech recognition, computer vision, online recommendation systems, bioinformatics, and videogames. Finally, the book offers research perspectives, covering such theoretical topics as linear factor models, autoencoders, representation learning, structured probabilistic models, Monte Carlo methods, the partition function, approximate inference, and deep generative models. Deep Learning can be used by undergraduate or graduate students planning careers in either industry or research, and by software engineers who want to begin using deep learning in their products or platforms. A website offers supplementary material for both readers and instructors.},

Our method is focused on the robot that has finite size of foot and designed to exploit its advantages. The foot allows for the range of ZMP presence and our algorithm use this ZMP range to absorb sensor noise, modeling error and certain amount of disturbances. Thanks to these effect, our step controller is able to produce new stepping time and the stepping position stably. From quadratic programming (QP) technique, we can consider maximum kinematical foot range and maximum foot velocity in the optimization process by setting inequality constraints. The CoM trajectory is replanned in each control cycle with a short cycle preview controller. The linear inverted pendulum model (LIPM) simulation and full dynamics simulation shows that our proposing method precisely reflect the advantages of footed robot and significant improvement in walking robustness to strong perturbation.},

Highly oriented CNT fibers can be obtained by the wet-spinning of CNTs in a superacid. We present a theoretical model for obtaining well-aligned CNT fibers, which may have superior properties. Our model predicts the minimum draw ratio (DR0) at various Deborah numbers (De) for CNT fibers with the target orientation. In addition, the stable operation window in the De-DR plane is predicted using linear stability analysis of the draw resonance. Our analysis suggests that a fiber with the target orientation factor can be obtained if and only if the draw ratio, DR, is higher than DR0 and is within a stable operation window. The model predictions for the stability window and the effect of DR on the properties of the fibers were confirmed by experiment.},

Adsorption reached equilibrium within 30 min, and the Freundlich capacity of the composite was 35.35 mg/g. The adsorption capacity of Cd(II) increased with increasing pH and was dependent on the ionic strength. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy showed the combination of surface hydroxyl groups of the composite and Cd(II) in the solution. The prepared composite can be easily recycled and reused by taking advantage of its magnetic properties. The results show that the designed composite is a promising absorbent for the treatment of Cd-contaminated water.},

  abstract = {ConspectusNature provides abundant inspiration and elegant paradigms for the development of smart materials that can actuate, morph, and move on demand. One remarkable capacity of living organisms is to adapt their shapes or positions in response to stimuli. Programmed deformations or movements in plant organs are mainly driven by water absorption/dehydration of cells, while versatile motions of mollusks are based on contraction/extension of muscles. Understanding the general principles of these morphing and motion behaviors can give rise to disruptive technologies for soft robotics, flexible electronics, biomedical devices, etc. As one kind of intelligent material, hydrogels with high similarity to soft biotissues and diverse responses to external stimuli are an ideal candidate to construct soft actuators and robots.The objective of this Account is to give an overview of the fundamental principles for controllable deformations and motions of hydrogels, with a focus on the structure designs and responsive functions of the corresponding soft actuators and robots. This field has been rapidly developed in recent years with a growing understanding of working principles in natural organisms and a substantial revolution of manufacturing technologies to devise bioinspired hydrogel systems with desired structures. Diverse morphing hydrogels and soft actuators/robots have been developed on the basis of several pioneering works, ranging from bending and folding deformations of bilayer hydrogels to self-shaping of non-Euclidean hydrogel surfaces, and from thermoactuated bilayer gel ``hands'' to electrodriven polyelectrolyte gel ``worms''. These morphing hydrogels have demonstrated active functions and versatile applications in biomedical and engineering fields.In this Account, we discuss recent progress in morphing hydrogels and highlight the design principles and relevant applications. First, we introduce the fundamentals of basic deformation modes, together with generic structure features, actuation strategies, and morphing mechanisms. The advantages of in-plane gradient structures are highlighted for programmable deformations by harnessing the out-of-plane buckling with bistability nature to obtain sophisticated three-dimensional configurations. Next, we give an overview of soft actuators and robots based on morphing hydrogels and focus on the working principles of the active systems with different structure designs. We discuss the advancements of hydrogel-based soft robots capable of swift locomotion with different gaits and emphasize the significances of structure control and dynamic actuation. Then we summarize versatile applications of hydrogel-based actuators and robots in biomedicines, cargo delivery, soft electronics, information encryption, and so forth. Some hydrogel robots with a built-in feedback loop and self-sensing system exhibit collaborative functions and advanced intelligence that are informative for the design of next-generation hydrogel machines. Finally, concluding remarks are given to discuss future opportunities and remaining challenges in this field. For example, miniature hydrogel-based actuators/robots with therapeutic or diagnostic functions are highly desired for biomedical applications. The morphing mechanisms summarized in this Account should be applicable to other responsive materials. We hope that this Account will inspire more scientists to be involved in this emerging area and make contributions to reveal novel working principles, design multifunctional soft machines, and explore applications in diverse fields.},

  abstract = {A stretchable supercapacitor at -30 \textdegree C was developed for the first time by               in situ               growth of polyaniline onto the newly-designed anti-freezing organohydrogel polyelectrolyte.                        ,                             At relatively low temperature (               e.g.               , -30 \textdegree C), most flexible supercapacitors that work well at room temperature will lose their stretchability due to the poor cold intolerance of conventional electrolytes and the absence of intrinsically stretchable electrodes. Herein, an anti-freezing and highly stretchable supercapacitor (AF-SSC) was fabricated for the first time by one-step               in situ               growth of polyaniline onto an organohydrogel polyelectrolyte from cross-linked polyacrylamide networks soaked by ethylene glycol/water/H               2               SO               4               . As no extra stretchable substrates (               e.g.               elastic fiber, polydimethylsiloxane, rubber,               etc.               ) or predefining stretchable structures (               e.g.               helical, spring, wrinkle, honeycombed structures               etc.               ) are needed in such a design, the prepared AF-SSC shows a high mechanical stretchability of 200\% at -30 \textdegree C and can be repeatedly stretched for 100 cycles without significant capacitance loss. Besides, an impressive capacitance retention of 73.1\% at -30 \textdegree C is achieved when the current density increases by 20 times, which is much higher than those of stretchable supercapacitors based on pseudocapacitive materials that operate at room temperature. Furthermore, the device shows an ultralong lifespan with 91.7\% capacitance retention after 100\,000 cycles at -30 \textdegree C, outperforming all stretchable supercapacitors reported previously. With other merits of high compressibility, strong adhesion, good processability and excellent anti-drying ability, the current device is an ideal power source to drive multi-functional electronic components in real-life scenarios.},

Recently, strong emphasis has been put on investigating various ionic polymer membranes for high-performance IPMC actuators and overcoming some drawbacks of ionic polymer actuators to improve stability and reliability. The paper gives an overview of different types of sulfonated ionic polymer membranes. Various emerging materials that exhibit notably good deformation, stability, and efficiency are extensively considered. A thorough comparison of different state-of-the-art ion exchange membranes is presented. Along with the material study, recent trends in modeling and control approached of IPMC actuators are presented. Although fundamental models of IPMC were proposed over a decade ago, physics-based models are still being developed in order to study specific aspects of the actuators and to develop a control design for practical applications. Therefore, this paper considers the latest actuation models and control designs of IPMC actuator and various promising prototype applications that lead the way in using the materials for real applications in future.},

Jung               et al               . developed a process to assemble nanomaterials as a monolayer that is partially embedded in an ultrathin elastomer. The process works by depositing a mixed solvent containing nanostructured silver and/or gold, along with elastomer, onto deionized water. This results in a layer of nanoparticles residing at the interface coating with elastomer, which is further densified by the addition of surfactant. The process is scalable, and the resulting elastomer membranes can be transferred to other substrates. \textemdash MSL                        ,              A float assembly method enables fabrication of highly conductive, stretchable, and ultrathin nanomembranes.           ,              Skin electronics require stretchable conductors that satisfy metallike conductivity, high stretchability, ultrathin thickness, and facile patternability, but achieving these characteristics simultaneously is challenging. We present a float assembly method to fabricate a nanomembrane that meets all these requirements. The method enables a compact assembly of nanomaterials at the water\textendash oil interface and their partial embedment in an ultrathin elastomer membrane, which can distribute the applied strain in the elastomer membrane and thus lead to a high elasticity even with the high loading of the nanomaterials. Furthermore, the structure allows cold welding and bilayer stacking, resulting in high conductivity. These properties are preserved even after high-resolution patterning by using photolithography. A multifunctional epidermal sensor array can be fabricated with the patterned nanomembranes.},

  abstract = {Precipitation in stirred vessels is a complex process involving interactions of physico-chemical nucleation and particle growth with fluid mixing. The simulation of precipitation via full CFD analysis still presents challenging computational difficulties. This paper seeks to examine how the fluid mixing influences the crystal size distribution (CSD) by applying simplified fluid mixing models. These can quantify how the separate effects of overall fluid convection, degrees of fluid macro-mixing and the extent of feed-separation determine the CSD. A new approach for describing particle growth has been developed. This model can solve the dynamic population balance equations by integration of ordinary differential equations. The model ensures the number balance as well as a mass balance on the solid, using a free discretised length grid approach. Then, the simulation under both a set of representative fluid mixing cases which varies the extent of macro-mixing (by sets of compartments or zones) and the different degrees of feed-separation (by different addition modes of the two reagents) were performed. It is predicted that joint feeds will give a larger and wider CSD, on the other hand, the most `extremely' separated feeding positions can compensate for the weakness of the macro-mixing. From this practioners will be able to choose the balance of stirring intensity and feed policies to increase or reduce crystal size, as well as adjust the shape of the CSD itself for double-jet operation. ᭧ 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Many conducting polymers have been proposed for the alternative electrodes, but they still have a problem of poor thermal stability. This article reports a novel all- organic actuator with single wall carbon nanotube (SWCNT) films as an alternative electrode. The SWCNT film was obtained by filtering a SWCNT solution through an anodized alumina membrane. The conductivity of the SWCNT film was about 280 S/cm. The performance of the SWCNT film electrode was characterized by measuring the dielectric properties of NASA Langley Research Center \textendash{} Electroactive Polymer (LaRC-EAP) sandwiched by the SWCNT electrodes over a broad range of temperature (from 25 to 280 \textdegree C) and frequency (from 1 kHz to 1 MHz).

  abstract = {Astounding results from Transformer models on natural language tasks have intrigued the vision community to study their application to computer vision problems. Among their salient benefits, Transformers enable modeling long dependencies between input sequence elements and support parallel processing of sequence as compared to recurrent networks e.g., Long short-term memory (LSTM). Different from convolutional networks, Transformers require minimal inductive biases for their design and are naturally suited as set-functions. Furthermore, the straightforward design of Transformers allows processing multiple modalities (e.g., images, videos, text and speech) using similar processing blocks and demonstrates excellent scalability to very large capacity networks and huge datasets. These strengths have led to exciting progress on a number of vision tasks using Transformer networks. This survey aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the Transformer models in the computer vision discipline. We start with an introduction to fundamental concepts behind the success of Transformers i.e., self-attention, large-scale pre-training, and bidirectional encoding. We then cover extensive applications of transformers in vision including popular recognition tasks (e.g., image classification, object detection, action recognition, and segmentation), generative modeling, multi-modal tasks (e.g., visual-question answering, visual reasoning, and visual grounding), video processing (e.g., activity recognition, video forecasting), low-level vision (e.g., image super-resolution, image enhancement, and colorization) and 3D analysis (e.g., point cloud classification and segmentation). We compare the respective advantages and limitations of popular techniques both in terms of architectural design and their experimental value. Finally, we provide an analysis on open research directions and possible future works.},

  abstract = {Snap-through buckling is commonly used in nature for power-amplified movements. While natural examples such as Utricularia and Dionaea muscipula can autonomously reset their snapping structures, bio-inspired analogues require external mediation for sequential snap events. Here we report the design principles for self-repeating, snap-based polymer jumping devices. Transient shape changes during the drying of a polymer gel are exploited to generate mechanical constraint and an internal driving force for snap-through buckling. Snap-induced shape changes alter environmental interactions to realize multiple, self-repeating snap events. The underlying mechanisms are understood through controlled experiments and numerical modelling. Using these lessons, we create snap-induced jumping devices with power density outputs (specific power\,{$\approx$}\,312\,W\,kg-1) that are similar to high-performing jumping organisms and engineered robots. These results provide the demonstration of an autonomous, self-repeating, high-speed movement, marking an important advance in the development of environmental energy harvesting, high-power motion that is important for microscale robots and actuated devices.},

The adsorbed structures of the ABDM molecules on graphite particles were examined in relation to zeta potential and critical micelle concentration. It was found that the zeta potential seems to be strongly correlated with both ABDM monolayer and bilayer formations on the particle surfaces. The total potential energies resulting from the interaction of the ABDM adsorbed graphite particles in suspension were estimated using the DLVO theory, and highly dispersed systems were obtained at 20 kT and higher. The adsorption amount of ABDM, zeta potential, graphite powder contact angle, and particle sedimentation rate were measured to determine the dispersion stability. It was found that the high dispersible graphite suspension with settling time T1=2 of 44.5 h at pH 10 and zeta potential of 22.5 mV was produced.},

Presently, stretchable and bendable graphene fibers are principally employing soft dielectric additives, such as polymers, which can significantly deteriorate the genuine electrical properties of pristine graphenebased structures. We report molecular-level lubricating nanodiamonds as an effective physical property modifier to improve the mechanical flexibility of graphene fibers by relieving the tight interlayer stacking among graphene sheets. Nanoscale-sized NDs effectively increase the tensile strain and bending strain of graphene/nanodiamond composite fibers while maintaining the genuine electrical conductivity of pristine graphene-based fibers. The molecular-level lubricating mechanism is elucidated by friction force microscopy on the nanoscale as well as by shear stress measurement on the macroscopic scale. The resultant highly bendable graphene/nanodiamond composite fiber is successfully weaved into all graphene fiber-based textiles and wearable Joule heaters, proposing the potential for reliable wearable applications.},

This work presents a nanofabrication strategy to create submicron-scale, all-soft electronic devices based on eutectic gallium-indium alloy (EGaIn) using a hybrid method utilizing electron-beam lithography and soft lithography. The hybrid lithography process is applied to a biphasic structure, comprising a metallic adhesion layer coated with EGaIn, to create soft nano/microstructures embedded in elastomeric materials. Submicron-scale EGaIn thin-film patterning with feature sizes as small as 180\,nm and 1\,{$\mu$}m line spacing was achieved, resulting in the highest resolution EGaIn patterning technique to date. The resulting soft and stretchable~EGaIn patterns offer a currently unrivaled combination of resolution, electrical conductivity, and electronic/wiring density.},

The double-layer modular design enables an increased areal coverage of LEDs and stretchable interconnectors with both electrical and mechanical stability. The main features of the double-layer modular design, fabrication processes, and device characteristics for the high fill factor, stretchable inorganic LED display are discussed, with experimental and computational results. Demonstrations of a passive matrix LED display confirm the potential value of the multi-layer structured, stretchable electronics in a wide range of applications that need high fill factor with high stretchability.},

Suspensions coarsen in the applied field, but do not phase separate fully due to attraction induced by their remenant magnetism. The structure and kinetics of coarsening depend on the aspect ratio of the particles. The coarsening of ellipsoids with aspect ratio {$\alpha$} = 2 depends on the field strength and toggle frequency. Longer ellipsoids ({$\alpha$} = 4) form long fibrous structures that aggregate laterally with kinetics that are less sensitive to the field conditions.

To improve the stretchability of PEDOT:PSS-based transparent electrode films, the intrinsically conducting polymer PEDOT:PSS was blended with highly stretchable nonionic waterborne polyurethane (WPU) and coated on a thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) film. Nonionic WPU has good compatibility with PEDOT:PSS, without affecting the acidity. WPU undergoes hydrogen bonding and coulombic attractions with PEDOT:PSS. With variation of the WPU content, differences in the electrical properties, such as the sheet resistance and mechanical stretchability, of the coated thin films were observed. The film with 2.0 wt\% WPU could be stretched to 400\% of the electrode surface without damage to the surface of the electrode films. The WPU and TPU films both have a polyester group, which provides good adhesion between the WPU-based transparent electrodes and the TPU substrate films. A stretchable alternating current electroluminescence (ACEL) device was constructed by using the water-based PEDOT:PSS/nonionic WPU composite as both the bottom and top transparent electrodes. The fabricated ACEL remained its initial luminance in the 500\% stretched state.},

Prepare to sweat                            Wearable technology is a popular way many people monitor their general health and fitness, tracking heart rate, calories, and steps. Koh               et al               . now take wearable technology one step further. They have developed and tested a flexible microfluidic device that adheres to human skin. This device collects and analyzes sweat during exercise. Using colorimetric biochemical assays and integrating smartphone image capture analysis, the device detected lactate, glucose, and chloride ion concentrations in sweat as well as sweat pH while stuck to the skin of individuals during a controlled cycling test. Colorimetric readouts showed comparable results to conventional analyses, and the sweat patches remained intact and functional even when used during an outdoor endurance bicycle race. The authors suggest that microfluidic devices could be used during athletic or military training and could be adapted to test other bodily fluids such as tears or saliva.                        ,              Capabilities in health monitoring enabled by capture and quantitative chemical analysis of sweat could complement, or potentially obviate the need for, approaches based on sporadic assessment of blood samples. Established sweat monitoring technologies use simple fabric swatches and are limited to basic analysis in controlled laboratory or hospital settings. We present a collection of materials and device designs for soft, flexible, and stretchable microfluidic systems, including embodiments that integrate wireless communication electronics, which can intimately and robustly bond to the surface of the skin without chemical and mechanical irritation. This integration defines access points for a small set of sweat glands such that perspiration spontaneously initiates routing of sweat through a microfluidic network and set of reservoirs. Embedded chemical analyses respond in colorimetric fashion to markers such as chloride and hydronium ions, glucose, and lactate. Wireless interfaces to digital image capture hardware serve as a means for quantitation. Human studies demonstrated the functionality of this microfluidic device during fitness cycling in a controlled environment and during long-distance bicycle racing in arid, outdoor conditions. The results include quantitative values for sweat rate, total sweat loss, pH, and concentration of chloride and lactate.},

Velocity of sedimentation is a controlling parameter in this process. The hydrodynamic forces of the system, interactions of particles with matrix and with each other control this parameter. In highly filled suspensions, particle\textendash particle interactions affect sedimentation more than the hydrodynamic and particle\textendash matrix interaction. Existence of polymer in the matrix would change matrix viscosity, affecting hydrodynamic motion of particles; and adsorption of polymer on the surface of particles would change surface properties, causing alteration in particle\textendash matrix and particle\textendash particle interactions. This work is a study of effect of polymer concentration on particle\textendash particle interactions. The results show that at low particle concentrations, addition of a small amount of polymer in the solution would decrease particle\textendash particle interactions. However, in a highly filled suspension, polymer does not affect particle\textendash particle interactions. Toluene was used as the solvent, nano-silica as the particle and polystyrene as the polymer. A high shear mixer was used to reduce the agglomeration of nano-silica particles, especially for highly filled suspensions. Sedimentation tests were performed in columns with a length of 50 cm and 26 mm in diameter.},

It is demonstrated that two liquids in a tube form a self-centered lens with a high optical quality. The motion of the lens during a focusing action was studied by observation through the transparent tube wall. Finally, a miniature achromatic camera module was designed and constructed based on this adjustable lens, showing that it is excellently suited for use in portable applications.},

  abstract = {When a suspension of conducting particles is sheared in a magnetic field, the fluid vorticity causes particle rotation. Eddy currents are induced in a conductor rotating in a magnetic field, resulting in magnetic moment, and a magnetic torque due to the external field. In the absence of inertia, the angular velocity of a particle is determined from the condition that the sum of the hydrodynamic and magnetic torques is zero. When the particle angular velocity is different from the fluid rotation rate, the torque exerted by the particles on the fluid results in an antisymmetric particle stress. The stress is of the form                                                                      \$\textbackslash unicode[STIX]\{x1D748\}\^\{(p)\}=|\textbackslash unicode[STIX]\{x1D74E\}|(\textbackslash unicode[STIX]\{x1D702\}\_\{c\}\^\{(1)\}(\textbackslash hat\{\textbackslash unicode[STIX]\{x1D750\}\}\textbackslash boldsymbol\{ : \}\textbackslash hat\{\textbackslash unicode[STIX]\{x1D74E\}\})+\textbackslash unicode[STIX]\{x1D702\}\_\{c\}\^\{(2)\}\textbackslash hat\{\textbackslash unicode[STIX]\{x1D750\}\}\textbackslash boldsymbol\{ : \}(\textbackslash hat\{\textbackslash boldsymbol\{H\}\}-\textbackslash hat\{\textbackslash unicode[STIX]\{x1D74E\}\}(\textbackslash hat\{\textbackslash unicode[STIX]\{x1D74E\}\}\textbackslash boldsymbol\{\textbackslash cdot \}\textbackslash hat\{\textbackslash boldsymbol\{H\}\}))/(\textbackslash sqrt\{1-(\textbackslash hat\{\textbackslash unicode[STIX]\{x1D74E\}\}\textbackslash boldsymbol\{\textbackslash cdot \}\textbackslash hat\{\textbackslash boldsymbol\{H\}\})\^\{2\}\})+\textbackslash unicode[STIX]\{x1D702\}\_\{c\}\^\{(3)\}(\textbackslash hat\{\textbackslash unicode[STIX]\{x1D74E\}\}\textbackslash hat\{\textbackslash boldsymbol\{H\}\}-\textbackslash hat\{\textbackslash boldsymbol\{H\}\}\textbackslash hat\{\textbackslash unicode[STIX]\{x1D74E\}\})/\textbackslash sqrt\{1-(\textbackslash hat\{\textbackslash unicode[STIX]\{x1D74E\}\}\textbackslash boldsymbol\{\textbackslash cdot \}\textbackslash hat\{\textbackslash boldsymbol\{H\}\})\^\{2\}\})\$                                               , where                                                                      \$\textbackslash unicode[STIX]\{x1D74E\}\$                                               is the fluid vorticity at the centre of the particle,                                                                      \$\textbackslash hat\{\textbackslash unicode[STIX]\{x1D74E\}\}\$                                               and                                                                      \$\textbackslash hat\{\textbackslash boldsymbol\{H\}\}\$                                               are the unit vectors in the direction of the fluid vorticity and the magnetic field,                                                                      \$\textbackslash hat\{\textbackslash unicode[STIX]\{x1D750\}\}\$                                               is the third order Levi-Civita antisymmetric tensor and                                                                      \$\textbackslash unicode[STIX]\{x1D702\}\_\{c\}\^\{(1)\}\$                                               ,                                                                      \$\textbackslash unicode[STIX]\{x1D702\}\_\{c\}\^\{(2)\}\$                                               and                                                                      \$\textbackslash unicode[STIX]\{x1D702\}\_\{c\}\^\{(3)\}\$                                               are called the first, second and third couple stress coefficients.

  abstract = {When a suspension of conducting particles is subjected to a shear flow, there is particle rotation due to the fluid vorticity. A conductor rotating in a uniform magnetic field experiences a torque due to eddy currents both parallel and perpendicular to the direction of rotation. Eddy currents induce a magnetic moment in a conducting particle, which disturbs the magnetic field around the particle. The effect of the Maxwell stress due to the magnetic field disturbance on the rheology of a dilute suspension is calculated in a manner similar to the Einstein viscosity for a suspension of rigid particles. The expression for the stress tensor contains three symmetric stress coefficients, and two normal stress coefficients, in addition to the three antisymmetric stress coefficients calculated in Kumaran (J. Fluid Mech., vol. 871, 2019, pp. 139\textendash 185). The stress coefficients depend on the relative orientation of the vorticity and magnetic field and two dimensionless parameters, {$\beta$}, the product of the vorticity and current relaxation time, and {$\Sigma$}, the ratio of the magnetic and hydrodynamic torques. In the `linear' approximation, where only terms linear in the particle magnetic moment are retained, the particle stress depends on two dimensionless functions. For the physically important limit {$\beta$} 1, as well as the limit {$\beta$} 1 and {$\Sigma$} 1, these two functions are independent of the vorticity, and depend only on the magnetic field and material properties.},

However, most of these device's func\- tionality and application is confined to either neutrally-buoyant or non-buoyant particles. For developing microfluidic devices that are capable of handling both particle types, an extensive numerical study based on a coupled Eulerian-Lagrangian framework for a mixture of neutrally-buoyant and non-buoyant particle types is performed. In the first part, simulations are performed on a straight channel with a rectangular cross-section to identify critical flow parameters affecting the migration dynamics of both particle types. Neutrally buoyant particles tend to migrate towards channel walls at high Re. In contrast, non-buoyant particles require low inflow Re for faster settling. An attempt to find critical Reynolds numbers (Re) to assist the separation of both particle types in straight channels is investigated. To address the shortcomings in straight channel design, the studies were extended to spiral designs to examine the effect of geometry-induced secondary flows on particle (neutrallybuoyant \& non-buoyant) trajectories. Finally, a hybrid microfluidic design based on a spiral structure with in\- termediate outlet and alternate contraction-expansion array (ACEA) that is capable of separating both particle types is proposed and tested for a wide parameter space.},

Molecular weights were calculated using Proton NMR spectroscopy for end-group analysis. Rheology and adsorption measurements of aqueous alumina slurries at various polymer dosages were acquired at pH 9.5. Based on the results of these studies, it was concluded that the molecular weight of an oligomer does have a significant effect on alumina suspensions. Moreover, there is an optimum molecular weight at which suspension viscosity is the lowest due to the amount of oligomer adsorbed onto alumina particles. In this study, oligomer C (1970 g/mol) with 2 mglg of alumina dosage in 0.50 volume Gaction alumina suspensions yielded the lowest viscosity and highest adsorption. Viscosity and adsorption values increased above and below 1970 g/mol molecular weight. In summary, efficiency of a dispersant is essentially related to the conditions under which it is used. Therefore, it is important to optimize aU conditions, molecular weight and charge interactions beiig most fundamental.},

  abstract = {When a ferromagnetic suspension flows through a capillary placed between two small strong permanent magnets, the magnetic force acts upon the non-magnetic (silica) particles dispersed in a ferrofluid and they tend to be extruded from the zone of high magnetic field. Particles get concentrated at the entrance section between magnets and form a plug. The increase of hydraulic resistance is due to the relative motion between particulate and ferrofluid phases in the presence of a field. If we keep the pressure difference constant, the flow rate will decrease when the field is applied and can eventually completely stop. In order to restart the flow a pressure difference, high enough to push the silica plug out of the capillary, is needed. The critical pressure of the flow blockage is nearly two times less than the pressure of the flow onset, both pressures being independent of the particle concentration in the suspension (except for near zero concentration). Such hysteresis of the flow onset/blockage has also been predicted in the frame of the proposed two-phase flow model, which has been used to calculate steady-state concentration profiles and discharge characteristics. \'O 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

This is a novel method that may be complementary to conventional techniques, such as light scattering, photographic methods, and rheological measurements. Compared to conventional techniques, the rheomagnetic method is uniquely suitable for process control during the early stages of slurry production in manufacturing, since it requires little test time, measures the ``dispersion quality'' of concentrated suspensions, operates automatically and can be implemented on-line. The rheomagnetic measurement is based on the following concepts. The particles are oriented in a predominantly extensional flow field and, because they are magnetic, their orientation can be detected with a weak magnetic sensing field. Because flocs of magnetic particles orient differently in a flow field than primary particles do, this method can be useful in obtaining information about the particle flocculation aspect of ``dispersion quality.'' A magnetic sensing field can also be used to detect the particle concentration in a quiescent flow. Experimental data on the effects of particle concentration and milling for rod-like y-Fez03and plate-like Ba-Ferrite suspensions are discussed. This is the first observation reported on the rheomagnetic orientation measurement for Ba-Ferrite magnetic particles, and the results markedly contrasted with those of the rod-like magnetic particles but showed similarity with those of rod-like y-Fez03.},

The octopus arm shows peculiar features, such as the ability to bend in all directions, to produce fast elongations, and to vary its stiffness. The octopus achieves these unique motor skills, thanks to its peculiar muscular structure, named muscular hydrostat. Different muscles arranged on orthogonal planes generate an antagonistic action on each other in the muscular hydrostat, which does not change its volume during muscle contractions, and allow bending and elongation of the arm and stiffness variation. By drawing inspiration from natural skills of octopus, and by analysing the geometry and mechanics of the muscular structure of its arm, we propose the design of a robot arm consisting of an artificial muscular hydrostat structure, which is completely soft and compliant, but also able to stiffen. In this paper, we discuss the design criteria of the robotic arm and how this design and the special arrangement of its muscular structure may bring the building of a robotic arm into being, by showing the results obtained by mathematical models and prototypical mock-ups.},

We show here that this resistance can be drastically reduced by preventing direct contact with the help of dual-length scale micro-structures and the concept of ``liquid-surfaces''. These new surfaces allow the gentle~transport of~droplets along defined paths and with fine control of their speed.

The gel coating helps suppress the electro-thermally induced puncturing of DEA membrane at the hot spot. As a result, the gel-coated DEAs, in either a single layer or a multilayer stack, can produce 30\% more isometric stress change as compared to those nonecoated. These gel-coated acrylic DEAs show great potential to make stronger artificial muscles.},

  abstract = {Stretchable conductive fibers have received significant attention due to their possibility of being utilized in wearable and foldable electronics. Here, highly stretchable conductive fiber composed of silver nanowires (AgNWs) and silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) embedded in a styrene\textendash butadiene\textendash styrene (SBS) elastomeric matrix is fabricated. An AgNW-embedded SBS fiber is fabricated by a simple wet spinning method. Then, the AgNPs are formed on both the surface and inner region of the AgNW-embedded fiber via repeated cycles of silver precursor absorption and reduction processes. The AgNW-embedded conductive fiber exhibits superior initial electrical conductivity ({$\sigma$}0 = 2450 S cm-1) and elongation at break (900\% strain) due to the high weight percentage of the conductive fillers and the use of a highly stretchable SBS elastomer matrix. During the stretching, the embedded AgNWs act as conducting bridges between AgNPs, resulting in the preservation of electrical conductivity under high strain (the rate of conductivity degradation, {$\sigma$}/{$\sigma$}0 = 4.4\% at 100\% strain). The AgNW-embedded conductive fibers show the strain-sensing behavior with a broad range of applied tensile strain. The AgNW reinforced highly stretchable conductive fibers can be embedded into a smart glove for detecting sign language by integrating five composite fibers in the glove, which can successfully perceive human motions.},

The effect of the sensor on human sensation was quantitatively investigated, and the sensor-applied finger exhibits comparable grip forces with those of the bare finger, even though the attachment of a 2-micrometer-thick polymeric film results in a 14\% increase in the grip force after adjusting for friction. Simultaneously, the sensor exhibits an extreme mechanical durability against cyclic shearing and friction greater than hundreds of kilopascals.},

Upon exposure to the acoustic field, the rodlike EGaIn colloidal motors can autonomously move at a speed of up to 34.5 {$\mu$}m s-1 without addition of any chemical fuels. The speed of motion is also able to be modulated by adjusting the acoustic voltage. Furthermore, these rodlike EGaIn colloidal motors could actively target and internalize into cancer cells which could be real-time monitored due to their photoluminance feature.

For instance, the combination of muscles actuation and skin sensing ensures our intelligent interaction with external environments. In terms of the soft robot, implanting sensation and actuation in one system can assist us to control it better and more efficiently. However, in the development of biomimetic materials, the simultaneous realization of actuating and sensing performance in bionic soft robots is still a great challenge. Here, we propose a novel asymmetric bilayer CNTs-elastomer/PNIPAm hydrogel composite with integrated actuating and sensing performances. Due to the excellent photothermal effect of CNTs and thermoresponsiveness of PNIPAm, under the NIR irradiation, the PNIPAm hydrogel layer would shrink and the bilayer composite would thus perform a bending deformation. At the same time, based on a piezoresistive sensing mechanism of the CNTs-elastomer, the actuating procedure can be recorded. This work may open up a new insight in the designing and fabricating intelligent biomimetic hydrogel soft robots with integrated selfsensing capacity.},

And the technology of soft actuators should be one of the key issues for developing such technologies. We have developed a soft actuator using the plasticized polyvinyl chloride (PVC) gel which has many positive characteristics, such as being soft and lightweight, having a stable actuation in the air with a high output, a notable response rate, a low power consumption and no noise. In this study, we applied the PVC gel soft actuators to develop a novel lightweight walking assist wear for a daily life support of the elderly people. We used the contraction and expansion movement and generation force of the actuators to provide the assistance. And we used some force sensors integrated in the insoles to detect the gait changes during walking. A prototype was designed, fabricated and the characteristics were evaluated in this paper. The prototype has a mass of about 0.6kg, with an output force about 94N (corresponding to torque of over 10\% of the nominal biological moment at the hip during unloaded walking), a power consumption of about 1.6W. The proposed assist wear has the advantages of a simple structure, light weight, high flexibility and easy to put on and take off which indicate the feasibility to use for a daily life walking assistance.},

Such electrical actuation is mainly achieved by electrowetting, with droplets attracted towards and spreading on a conductive substrate in response to an applied voltage. To ensure strong and practical actuation, the substrate is covered with a dielectric layer and a hydrophobic topcoat~for electrowetting-on-dielectric (EWOD)11-13; this increases the actuation voltage (to about 100 volts) and can compromise reliability owing to dielectric breakdown14, electric charging15 and biofouling16. Here we demonstrate droplet manipulation that uses electrical signals to induce the liquid to dewet, rather than wet, a hydrophilic conductive substrate without the need for added layers. In this electrodewetting mechanism, which is phenomenologically opposite to electrowetting, the liquid\textendash substrate interaction is not controlled~directly~by electric field but instead by field-induced attachment and detachment of ionic surfactants to the substrate. We show that this actuation mechanism can perform all the basic fluidic operations of digital microfluidics using water on doped silicon wafers in air, with only {$\pm$}2.5 volts~of driving voltage, a few microamperes of current and about 0.015 times the critical micelle concentration of an ionic surfactant. The system can also handle common buffers and organic solvents, promising a simple and reliable microfluidic platform for a broad range of applications.},

  abstract = {颗粒测试在工业生产和科学研究中涉及的领域非常广泛,常用的颗粒粒度及其分布的测试方法是激光粒度测试法。目前市场上通常使用硅光电池或光电二极管作为激光粒度仪的探测器,输出模拟信号,信号不稳定,而CCD探测器分辨率高,输出稳定的数字信号,其作为激光粒度仪探测器的应用已经很普遍了。本论文通过对CCD探测技术的研究,提出了应用图像处理的方法设计光电探测器,实现了基于米氏(Mie)散射原理的激光粒度测试系统。主要完成的工作如下：首先,深入研究了Mie散射理论以及激光粒度仪的工作原理,分析了单个颗粒及颗粒群的散射光能量分布函数,推导了光能系数矩阵的计算过程。其次,完成了基于CCD探测的激光粒度仪系统研究,主要包括光路系统和图像采集处理系统研究。设计与实现了粒度仪的光电探测器,其选用CCD采集光散射能量图,再对图像进行处理,完成了激光粒度测试的实验系统。第三,研究了粒度反演算法,即非独立模式和独立模式反演算法,并且总结了这两种反演算法各自的特点。非独立模式算法需要事先确定粒度分布模型,当实际颗粒分布与理想值不相符合的情况下,就会导致相当大的误差,因而使其应用受到了限制；而独立模式算法不需要预先确定粒度分布的模型,理论上可以计算任何颗粒的粒度分布,但抗噪声能力差,容易引起测量误差。本文提出了一种改进的独立模式粒度反演算法,并对算法的性能进行了理论分析和实验论证。最后,在完成实验系统搭建的基础上,实现了对(1-100){$\mu$}m标准样品的实验测试,并对实验结果进行分析。通过本课题的研究,完成了基于CCD技术的激光粒度测试系统理论和实验研究。实验研究表明,采用CCD作为激光粒度仪的探测器及利用图像处理技术对散射图进行处理是可行的,满足了现代粉体工业粒度测量的要求。},

  abstract = {Elastomer fiber mat sensors, which are capable of perceiving mechanical stimuli, temperature, and vapor of chemicals, are highly desirable for designing wearable electronics and human-robot interfacing devices due to good wearability, skin affinity, and durability, and so on. However, it is still challenging to fabricate multiresponsive flexible wearable sensors with threedimensional (3D) architecture using simple material and structure design. Herein, we report an all-in-one multiresponsive thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) nanofiber mat sensors composed of crimped elastomer fibers with deposited platinum nanoparticles (PtNPs) on the fiber surface. The 1D TPU nanofibers could be transferred to nanofibers with different 3D nanofiber architectures by controllable macromolecular chain relaxation of aligned elastomer polymers upon poor solvent annealing. The conductive networks of PtNPs on wavy TPU fibers enable the sensor susceptible to multiple stimuli like strain/pressure, humidity, and organic vapors. Besides, the 3D nanofiber architectures allow the strain sensor to detect wider tensile strain and pressure with higher sensitivity due to delicate fiber morphology and structure control. Therefore, this work provides new insights into the fabrication of multifunctional flexible sensors with 3D architecture in an easy way, advancing the establishment of a multiple signal monitoring platform for the health care and human-machine interfacing.},

  abstract = {Nanotube Yarn Actuators                            Actuators are used to convert heat, light, or electricity into a twisting or tensile motion, and are often described as artificial muscles. Most materials that show actuation either provide larger forces with small-amplitude motions, such as the alloy NiTi, or provide larger motions with much less force, such as polymeric materials. Other problems with such actuators can include slow response times and short lifetimes.                                Lima                 et al.

Typical problems include slow response, low strain and force generation, short cycle life, use of electrolytes, and low energy efficiency. We have designed guest-filled, twist-spun carbon nanotube yarns as electrolyte-free muscles that provide fast, high-force, large-stroke torsional and tensile actuation. More than a million torsional and tensile actuation cycles are demonstrated, wherein a muscle spins a rotor at an average 11,500 revolutions/minute or delivers 3\% tensile contraction at 1200 cycles/minute. Electrical, chemical, or photonic excitation of hybrid yarns changes guest dimensions and generates torsional rotation and contraction of the yarn host. Demonstrations include torsional motors, contractile muscles, and sensors that capture the energy of the sensing process to mechanically actuate.},

A developed drag force coefficient to fully consider the anisotropics was applied to model and simulate dense particle-laden flows. Coupled with a unified second-order moment, 2-fluid turbulent model consisting of a set of fluctuation velocity Reynolds transport equations was employed for predicting dense particle-laden flows in pseudo-2D horizontal chamber. Simulated results showed that they are in good agreement with measurement data. Particle Reynolds stresses have been redistributed by the momentum transfer interaction term between gas and particle phases, the turbulent diffusion term, and the particle collision term. Compared with traditional Wen's model, horizontal and vertical root-mean-square of particle velocities exhibited much more flatter and wider distribution behaviors. Due to limitation of two-dimensional model and wall conditions, errors near wall regions should be improved in future work.},

However, the compliance that makes them attractive also makes soft robots difficult to control. We present two low-cost approaches to control the motion of soft actuators in applications common in human-interaction tasks. First, we present a passive impedance approach, which employs restriction to pneumatic channels to regulate the inflation/deflation rate of a pneumatic actuator and eliminate the overshoot/oscillation seen in many underdamped silicone-based soft actuators. Second, we present a visual servoing feedback control approach. We present an elastomeric pneumatic finger as an example system on which both methods are evaluated and compared to an uncontrolled underdamped actuator. We perturb the actuator and demonstrate its ability to increase distal curvature around the obstacle and maintain the desired end position. In this approach, we use the continuum deformation characteristic of soft actuators as an advantage for control rather than a problem to be minimized. With their low cost and complexity, these techniques present great opportunity for soft robots to improve human\textendash robot interaction.},

Owing to the extremely high pressure in the deep sea, rigid vessels5\textendash 7 and pressure-compensation systems8\textendash 10 are typically required to protect mechatronic systems. However, deep-sea creatures that lack bulky or heavy pressure-tolerant systems can thrive at extreme depths11\textendash 17. Here, inspired by the structure of a deep-sea snailfish15, we develop an untethered soft robot for deep-sea exploration, with onboard power, control and actuation protected from pressure by integrating electronics in a silicone matrix. This self-powered robot eliminates the requirement for any rigid vessel. To reduce shear stress at the interfaces between electronic components, we decentralize the electronics by increasing the distance between components or separating them from the printed circuit board. Careful design of the dielectric elastomer material used for the robot's flapping fins allowed the robot to be actuated successfully in a field test in the Mariana Trench down to a depth of 10,900~metres and to swim freely in the South China Sea at a depth of 3,224~metres. We validate the pressure resilience of the electronic components and soft actuators through systematic experiments and theoretical analyses.

  abstract = {Electronic skin (E-skin) is a crucial seamless human-machine interface (HMI), holding promise in healthcare monitoring and personal electronics. Liquid metal (LM) has been recognized as an ideal electrode material to fabricate E-skins. However, conventional sealed LM electrodes cannot expose the LM layer for direct contact with the skin resulting in the low performance of electrophysiological monitoring. Furthermore, traditional printed LM electrodes are difficult to transfer or recycle, and fractures easily occur under stretching of the substrate. Here, we report a kind of LM electrode that we call a kirigami-structured LM paper (KLP), which is self-supporting, conductor-exposing, stretchable, ultrathin, and recyclable for multifunctional E-skin. The KLP is fabricated by the kirigami paper cutting art with three types of structures including uniaxial, biaxial, and square spiral. The KLP can act as an E-skin to acquire high-quality electrophysiological signals, such as electroencephalogram (EEG), electrocardiogram (ECG), and electromyogram (EMG). Upon integration with a triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG), the KLP can also operate as a selfpowered E-skin. On the basis of the self-powered E-skin, we further developed a smart dialing communication system, which is applied on human skin to call a cellphone. Compared with conventional sealed or printed LM electrodes, the KLP can simultaneously achieve self-supporting, conductor-exposing, stretchable, ultrathin, and recyclable features. Such KLP offers potential for E-skins in healthcare monitoring and intelligent control, as well as smart robots, virtual reality, on-skin personal electronics, etc.},

State-of-the-art wearable sensors, however, lack sensing reliability towards either fickle wearable microclimate or multi-direction mechanical inputs, which leads to a suboptimal sensing accuracy throughout the implementation. In this work, we propose an assembly-flexible strain sensing network based on a carbon nanotube percolated configuration. The sensor possesses high reliability upon microenvironment change of wearable interfaces by taking advantage of the sensing stability in various temperatures, humidity, aqueous acid, and alkaline solutions. The response to bending, twisting, and pressuring is also marginal, guaranteeing sensing dependability against multi-direction mechanical inputs in practical wearable scenarios. By being integrated with deep learning and control systems, the high-performance and biocompatible strain gauges can precisely identify hand gestures and manipulate the upwards/downwards bending of a robot wrist. It demonstrates huge potential in motion identification and man-machine interaction.},

Herein, we review the latest advances in functionalization and device fabrication of fiber materials toward applications in fiber-based wearable strain sensors. We describe the approaches for preparing conductive fibers such as spinning, surface modification, and structural transformation. We also introduce the fabrication and sensing mechanisms of state-of-the-art sensors and analyze their merits and demerits. The applications toward motion detection, healthcare, man\textendash machine interaction, future entertainment, and multifunctional sensing are summarized with typical examples.

We summarize challenges and solutions of small object detection, and present major deep learning techniques, including fusing feature maps, adding context information, balancing foreground-background examples, and creating sufficient positive examples. We discuss related techniques developed in four research areas, including generic object detection, face detection, object detection in aerial imagery, and segmentation. In addition, this paper compares the performances of several leading deep learning methods for small object detection, including YOLOv3, Faster R-CNN, and SSD, based on three large benchmark datasets of small objects. Our experimental results show that while the detection accuracy on small objects by these deep learning methods was low, less than 0.4, Faster R-CNN performed the best, while YOLOv3 was a close second.},

  abstract = {Soft robots built with active soft materials have been increasingly attractive. Despite tremendous efforts in soft sensors and actuators, it remains extremely challenging to construct intelligent soft materials that simultaneously actuate and sense their own motions, resembling living organisms' neuromuscular behaviors. This work presents a soft robotic strategy that couples actuation and strain-sensing into a single homogeneous material, composed of an interpenetrating double-network of a nanostructured thermo-responsive hydrogel poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAAm) and a light-absorbing, electrically conductive polymer polypyrrole (PPy). This design grants the material both photo/thermal-responsiveness and piezoresistive-responsiveness, enabling remotely-triggered actuation and local strain-sensing. This self-sensing actuating soft material demonstrated ultra-high stretchability (210\%) and large volume shrinkage (70\%) rapidly upon irradiation or heating (13\%/\textdegree C, 6-time faster than conventional PNIPAAm). The significant deswelling of the hydrogel network induces densification of percolation in the PPy network, leading to a drastic conductivity change upon locomotion with a gauge factor of 1.0. The material demonstrated a variety of precise and remotely-driven photo-responsive locomotion such as signal-tracking, bending, weightlifting, object grasping and transporting, while simultaneously monitoring these motions itself via real-time resistance change. The multifunctional sensory actuatable materials may lead to the next-generation soft robots of higher levels of autonomy and complexity with self-diagnostic feedback control.},

Diverse functional devices based on dielectric elastomer actuators have been developed. To mimic a slender shape muscle-like actuator with the capability of large actuation, however still remains a challenge. The fiber constrained dielectric elastomer actuator (FCDEA) was previously presented but only 30\% unidirectional actuation strain was obtained. In this work, By using suitable stiff fibers to withstand large horizontal pre-stretch, up to 142\% linear actuation strain is achieved. We demonstrate that the actuator is independent of the length ratio, making it possible to mimic natural muscle of slender shape. Theoretical predictions agree remarkably well with the experimental results. As a demonstration, we incorporate the FCDEA into a bioinspired artificial arm. After applying voltage, 70 degree rotation is achieved for the forearm relative to the fixed upper arm. The bioinspired design with the unique properties of dielectric elastomers shows the potential to use FCDEA to function as artificial muscle.},

  abstract = {形状记忆聚合物材料与形状记忆合金和形状记忆陶瓷相比较,具有许多优异的性能,如其最大形状恢复应变可达到100\%以上、密度低、制备工艺简单、形状恢复温度可调节和生产制造成本低等。这些优势使形状记忆聚合物材料的应用前景特别广阔,目前它已经在航空航天、汽车、通讯和仿生医学等重要领域有了初步的应用。因此形状记忆聚合物材料的研究是目前智能材料与结构领域内的最热点之一。然而目前热敏性形状记忆聚合物的形状记忆效应驱动通常是通过直接加热的方式实现,这一驱动方式的驱动效率很低,并且在实施过程中也存在许多不方便。另一方面,由于热敏性形状记忆聚合物材料做为一种新兴的智能材料,其发展的历史相对较短,研究者对它的理论认识还不够全面,也不深刻,导致不能彻底分析并认识隐藏在材料宏观表象之后的微观机理。这些问题的存在,严重地限制了形状记忆聚合物的深入发展和应用。在这样的背景下,本论文提出并从实验方面实现混杂导电纤维填充型形状记忆聚合物纳米复合材料（固-固混合体系）和nanopaper复合型形状记忆聚合物纳米复合材料的电致驱动方式,发现并证实了溶剂和形状记忆聚合物混合体系（固-液混合体系）的溶液驱动方式,以及从理论方面推导并解释了上述形状记忆聚合物混合体系的热力学本构方程。本文第三章研究的内容是混杂导电纤维填充型形状记忆聚合物纳米复合材料和碳纳米纸复合型形状记忆聚合物纳米复合材料。采用电子扫描电镜、偏光显微镜、示差扫描量热仪、动态机械性能热分析仪、静态力学性能测试系统、四点探针电阻测量方法和Van der Pawu四点电阻测量方法系统地研究电致驱动形状记忆聚合物纳米复合材料的微观结构、玻璃化转变温度、热力学行为和电学属性。进而通过驱动实验,验证纳米复合材料的电致驱动形状记忆效应,并采用红外成像仪等设备记录了电致驱动形状记忆效应的形状恢复行为和温度场分布。然后根据实验结果分析并总结材料成分种类、含量以及其电学属性对电致驱动形状记忆聚合物纳米复合材料形状记忆效应的影响规律。在第四章的研究内容,通过引入塑性效应理论、高分子溶液理论、橡胶弹性理论和松弛理论等系统地提出并阐述``热敏性形状记忆聚合物的溶液驱动形状记忆效应''概念。进而采用苯乙烯基形状记忆聚合物作为试验对象,实验上证实热敏性苯乙烯基形状记忆聚合物的溶剂驱动形状记忆效应。期间发现并分别实现N, N-二甲基甲酰胺溶剂的化学极化效应驱动形状记忆效应和甲苯溶剂的物理溶胀增塑效应驱动形状记忆效应。采用热失重分析仪、示差扫描量热仪、动态机械性能热分析仪和红外光谱分析仪等设备研究并分析溶液驱动形状记忆聚合物的热力学行为和化学结构演变规律。总结溶液驱动形状记忆效应的作用机理是溶剂分子通过扩散作用渗透到聚合物材料中,被吸收的溶剂分子对聚合物网络结构产生增塑作用。增塑效应可以降低聚合物网络结构内部分子链段之间的相互作用力,提升聚合物分子链段的柔顺性和运动能力,进而与聚合物分子产生化学的或物理的相互作用,从而间接地降低聚合物材料的转变温度。当聚合物的转变温度降低至室温时,固定在形状记忆聚合物分子链段内部的弹性应变能得以释放,形状记忆效应因此触发。对于热敏性形状记忆聚合物,其形状记忆行为遵循松弛理论及其Eyring方程。从Eyring方程可知,形状记忆效应不仅受温度的影响,同时也受聚合物网络内聚能（或化学势）的影响,并且只决定于这两个影响因素。在第五章的研究内容中,通过改变形状记忆聚合物网络化学势的方式对热敏性形状记忆聚合物的形状记忆行为进行分析和研究。在聚合物与其固体或液体溶剂混合过程中,混合体系的熵函数和自由能函数等热力学参数会发生改变。由此联立混合过程中的热力学方程和松弛方程,可定量地获得聚合物网络的化学势在混合过程中受溶剂（或聚合物）在混合体系的体积百分含量、聚合物分子与溶剂分子的摩尔体积比和Flory-Huggins相互作用参数的影响规律。进而引入自由能方程,从理论方面推导并解释形状记忆聚合物混合体系,在不同受力状态下关于聚合物的化学势-应变和混合体系的应力-应变本构方程。},

Fundamental properties of these new materials are presented, and examples of potential undersea applications are examined in order to assist those involved in device design and in actuator research to evaluate the current status and the developing potential of these artificial muscle technologies. Technologies described are based on newly explored materials developed over the past decade, and also on older materials whose properties are not widely known. The materials are dielectric elastomers, ferroelectric polymers, liquid crystal elastomers, thermal and ferroelectric shape memory alloys, ionic polymer/metal composites, conducting polymers, and carbon nanotubes.

However, most existing actuators show a lack of high bending displacement and irregular response characteristics under low input voltages. Here, based on metal free covalent triazine frameworks (CTFs), we report an electro-ionic soft actuator that shows high bending deformation under ultralow input voltages that can be implemented as a soft robotic touch finger on fragile displays. The as-synthesized CTFs, derived from a polymer of intrinsic microporosity (PIM-1), were combined with poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT-PSS) to make a flexible electrode for a high-performance electro-ionic soft actuator. The proposed soft touch finger showed high peak-to-peak displacement of 17.0\,mm under ultralow square voltage of {$\pm$}0.5\,V, with 0.1\,Hz frequency and 4 times reduced phase delay in harmonic response compared with that of a pure PEDOT-PSS-based actuator. The significant actuation performance is mainly due to the unique physical and chemical configurations of CTFs electrode with highly porous and electrically conjugated networks. On a fragile display, the developed soft robotic touch finger array was successfully used to perform soft touching, similar to that of a real human finger; device was used to accomplish a precise task, playing electronic piano.},

On the other hand, explicitly exploiting the self-similarities of natural images has led to the successful non-local means approach to image restoration. We propose simultaneous sparse coding as a framework for combining these two approaches in a natural manner. This is achieved by jointly decomposing groups of similar signals on subsets of the learned dictionary. Experimental results in image denoising and demosaicking tasks with synthetic and real noise show that the proposed method outperforms the state of the art, making it possible to effectively restore raw images from digital cameras at a reasonable speed and memory cost.},

In an acidic solution, particles are cleaned by dissolution of the iron hydroxide precipitate. A silica surface protects the superparamagnetic microparticles from dissolution rendering their reuse as seeds and magnetic carriers possible.

  abstract = {Strain modulation based on the heterogeneous design of soft substrates is an effective method to improve the sensitivity of stretchable resistive strain sensors. In this study, a novel design for reconfigurable strain modulation in the soft substrate with two-phase liquid cells is proposed. The modulatory strain distribution induced by the reversible phase transition of the liquid metal provides reconfigurable strain sensing capabilities with multiple combinations of operating range and sensitivity. The effectiveness of our strategy is validated by theoretical simulations and experiments on a hybrid carbonous film-based resistive strain sensor. The strain sensor can be gradually switched between a highly sensitive one and a wide-range one by selectively controlling the phases of liquid metal in the cell array with a external heating source. The relative change of sensitivity and operating range reaches a maximum of 59\% and 44\%, respectively. This reversible heterogeneous design shows great potential to facilitate the fabrication of strain sensors and might play a promising role in the future applications of stretchable strain sensors.},

However, their bulky nature restricts close collaboration with humans. Here, we introduce soft electromagnetic actuators (SEMAs) by replacing solid metal coils with liquid-metal channels embedded in elastomeric shells. We demonstrate human-friendly, simple, stretchable, fast, durable, and programmable centimeter-scale SEMAs that drive a soft shark, interact with everyday objects, or rapidly mix a dye with water. A multicoil flower SEMA with individually controlled petals blooms or closes within tens of milliseconds, and a cubic SEMA performs programmed, arbitrary motion sequences. We develop a numerical model supporting design and opening potential routes toward miniaturization, reduction of power consumption, and increase in mechanical efficiency. SEMAs are electrically controlled shape-morphing systems that are potentially empowering future applications from soft grippers to minimally invasive medicine.},

  abstract = {A method of quantifying vorticity in triaxial magnetic fields is presented that predicts vorticity for fields that cannot be treated by symmetry theories.           ,                             We recently reported two methods of inducing vigorous fluid vorticity in magnetic particle suspensions. The first method employs symmetry-breaking rational fields. These fields are comprised of two orthogonal ac components whose frequencies form a rational number and an orthogonal dc field that breaks the symmetry of the biaxial ac field to create the parity required to induce deterministic vorticity. The second method is based on rational triads, which are fields comprised of three orthogonal ac components whose frequency ratios are rational (               e.g.               , 1\,:\,2\,:\,3). For each method a symmetry theory has been developed that enables the prediction of the direction and sign of vorticity as functions of the field frequencies and phases. However, this theory has its limitations. It only applies to those particular phase angles that give rise to fields whose Lissajous plots, or principal 2-d projections thereof, have a high degree of symmetry. Nor can symmetry theory provide a measure of the magnitude of the torque density induced by the field. In this paper a functional of the multiaxial magnetic field is proposed that not only is consistent with all of the predictions of the symmetry theories, but also quantifies the torque density. This functional can be applied to fields whose Lissajous plots lack symmetry and can thus be used to predict a variety of effects and trends that cannot be predicted from the symmetry theories. These trends include the dependence of the magnitude of the torque density on the various frequency ratios, the unexpected reversal of flow with increasing dc field amplitude for certain symmetry-breaking fields, and the existence of off-axis vorticity for rational triads, such as 1\,:\,3\,:\,5, that do not have the symmetry required to analyze by symmetry theory. Experimental data are given that show the degree to which this functional is successful in predicting observed trends.},

However, with the increasing restriction on the use of chromic acid and the application of lithium-containing aluminium alloys to aircraft structures, the capability of anodizing as a NDT method is challenged. In this work, machining damage was deliberately introduced to an Al-Li-Cu alloy AA2099-T8. Then, the visibility of the machine damage after tartaric-sulphuric acid anodizing (TSAA), which is an environmentally friendly anodizing process, was studied. It is suggested that, with proper lighting condition, it is possible to replace CAA with TSAA for detecting machining damage on lithium-containing aluminium alloys during manufacturing.},

  abstract = {The spreading of a droplet of a liquid on a smooth solid surface is often described by the Hoffman-de Gennes law, which relates the edge speed, ve, to the dynamic and equilibrium contact angles \texttheta{} and \texttheta e by ve {$\propto\theta$}(\texttheta 2 -\texttheta e2 ). When the liquid wets the surface completely and the equilibrium contact angle vanishes, the edge speed is proportional to the cube of the dynamic contact angle. When the droplets are non-volatile this law gives rise to simple power laws with time for the contact angle and other parameters in both the capillary and gravity dominated regimes. On a textured surface the equilibrium state of a droplet is strongly modified due to the amplification of the surface chemistry induced tendencies by the topography. The most common example is the conversion of hydrophobicity into superhydrophobicity. However, when the surface chemistry favors partial wetting, topography can result in a droplet spreading completely. A further, frequently over-looked consequence of topography is that the rate at which an out-of-equilibrium droplet spreads should also be modified. In this report, we review ideas related to the idea of topography induced wetting and consider how this may relate to dynamic wetting and the rate of droplet spreading. We consider the effect of the Wenzel and Cassie-Baxter equations on the driving forces and discuss how these may modify power-laws for spreading. We relate the ideas to both the hydrodynamic viscous dissipation model and the molecular-kinetic theory of spreading. This suggests roughness and solid surface fraction modified Hoffman-de Gennes laws relating the edge speed to the dynamic and equilibrium contact angle. We also consider the spreading of small droplets and stripes of non-volatile liquids in the capillary regime and large droplets in the gravity regime. In the case of small non-volatile droplets spreading completely, a roughness modified Tanner's law giving the dependence of dynamic contact angle on time is presented. We review existing data for the spreading of small droplets of polydimethylsiloxane oil on surfaces decorated with micro-posts. On these surfaces, the initial droplet spreads with an approximately constant volume and the edge speed-dynamic contact angle relationship follows a power law ve{$\propto\theta$} p. As the surface texture becomes stronger the exponent from p=3 towards p=1 in agreement with a Wenzel roughness driven spreading and a roughness modified Hoffman-de Genne's power law. Finally, we suggest that when a droplet spreads to a final partial wetting state on a rough surface, it approaches its Wenzel equilibrium contact angle in an exponential manner with a time constant dependent on roughness.},

Here we show that liquid dielectrophoresis or electrowetting can produce wetting on normally non-wetting surfaces, without needing modification of the surface topography or chemistry. Additionally, superspreading can be achieved without needing surfactants in the liquid. Here we use a modified Hoffman-de Gennes law to predict three distinct spreading regimes: exponential approach to an equilibrium shape, spreading to complete wetting obeying a Tanner's law-type relationship and superspreading towards a complete wetting film. We demonstrate quantitative experimental agreement with these predictions using dielectrophoresis-induced spreading of stripes of 1,2 propylene glycol. Our findings show how the rate of spreading of a partial wetting system can be controlled using uniform and non-uniform electric fields and how to induce more rapid superspreading using voltage control.},

We formulate this task as a frame-to-frame set prediction problem and introduce TrackFormer, an end-to-end MOT approach based on an encoder-decoder Transformer architecture. Our model achieves data association between frames via attention by evolving a set of track predictions through a video sequence. The Transformer decoder initializes new tracks from static object queries and autoregressively follows existing tracks in space and time with the new concept of identity preserving track queries. Both decoder query types benefit from self- and encoder-decoder attention on global frame-level features, thereby omitting any additional graph optimization and matching or modeling of motion and appearance. TrackFormer represents a new tracking-by-attention paradigm and yields state-of-the-art performance on the task of multi-object tracking (MOT17) and segmentation (MOTS20).

  abstract = {As soft electrostatic actuators find applications in bio-inspired robotics, compact and lightweight high voltage electronics that independently address many actuators are required. Here, a pocket-sized, battery-powered, 10-channel high voltage power supply (HVPS) is presented, which independently addresses each channel up to 10 kV. The HVPS uses one HV amplifier to create a HV rail and each output connects to the rail via custom optocouplers that are pulse-width modulated to vary their conductance. These optocouplers distribute charges to and from electrostatic devices at each output, creating a charge-controlled driving scheme that can generate independent and nearly arbitrary actuation waveforms for each channel. The HVPS weighs 250 g and measures 8.4 cm \texttimes{} 13.3 cm \texttimes{} 2 cm, about the size of a smartphone. The HVPS is characterized when driving hydraulically amplified self-healing electrostatic (HASEL) actuators. While powering a 5 nF actuator, the output of the HVPS reaches 8 kV in 100 ms and drives a 1.5 nF actuator at 100 Hz (0 to 5.4 kV). The HVPS powers an active surface consisting of an array of HASELs and generates undulatory locomotion of a soft robotic inchworm, highlighting the potential for compact HV electronics that power multi-degree-of-freedom robotic systems based on electrostatic devices.},

  abstract = {Reliable measurement of the size-resolved number concentration (size distribution) of solid particles dispersed in water or melted ice is of critical importance in many geoscientific observational studies. Because physical and chemical properties of particles can be measured more unambiguously and accurately in rarefied media (air) than in condensed media (water), particle measurement after aerosolization using a nebulizer is a significant method for the observation of solid particles dispersed in water. We propose a mathematical theory for estimating the original size distribution of solid particles in water from the measured size distribution of aerosolized particles. We assume that the size distribution of water droplets produced by a nebulizer is given. The size distribution of solid particles in water can be estimated by solving a system of nonlinear equations. The complexity in solving the equations increases rapidly with the computational resolution of particle size and the assumed maximum number of particles within each droplet. For such a system of equations, we found rigorous error bounds of a true solution using INTLAB, an interval arithmetic package. Our theoretical framework will be useful in many fields in geoscience as a fundamental scheme to quantify solid particles in water. In particular, an application of the proposed theoretical method is shown to be useful for the quantitative observations of the size distribution of black carbon particles in rainwater.},

  abstract = {Electrowetting has become one of the most widely used tools for manipulating tiny amounts of liquids on surfaces. Applications range from `lab-on-a-chip' devices to adjustable lenses and new kinds of electronic displays. In the present article, we review the recent progress in this rapidly growing field including both fundamental and applied aspects. We compare the various approaches used to derive the basic electrowetting equation, which has been shown to be very reliable as long as the applied voltage is not too high. We discuss in detail the origin of the electrostatic forces that induce both contact angle reduction and the motion of entire droplets. We examine the limitations of the electrowetting equation and present a variety of recent extensions to the theory that account for distortions of the liquid surface due to local electric fields, for the finite penetration depth of electric fields into the liquid, as well as for finite conductivity effects in the presence of AC voltage. The most prominent failure of the electrowetting equation, namely the saturation of the contact angle at high voltage, is discussed in a separate section. Recent work in this direction indicates that a variety of distinct physical effects\textemdash rather than a unique one\textemdash are responsible for the saturation phenomenon, depending on experimental details. In the presence of suitable electrode patterns or topographic structures on the substrate surface, variations of the contact angle can give rise not only to continuous changes of the droplet shape, but also to discontinuous morphological transitions between distinct liquid morphologies. The dynamics of electrowetting are discussed briefly. Finally, we give an overview of recent work aimed at commercial applications, in particular in the fields of adjustable lenses, display technology, fibre optics, and biotechnology-related microfluidic devices.},

Selective patterning of PFSA films on an inert soft substrate (polyethylene terephthalate film) facilitates the formation of a range of different geometries, including a 2D (two-dimensional) roll or 3D (three-dimensional) helical structure in response to vapor stimuli. Chemical modification of the surface allowed the development of a kirigami-inspired single-layer actuator for personal humidity and heat management through macroscale geometric design features, to afford a bilayer stimuli-responsive actuator with multicolor switching capability.},

Though several modelling methods have been proposed before to understand their mechanical, chemical, electrical behaviours or `electro-chemo-mechanical' behaviour, estimating the whole shape deflection of the EAP actuators has not been studied yet. Therefore, we report on (i) an effective methodology to estimate these actuators' whole shape deflection by employing a soft robotic actuator/manipulator approach and (ii) an angle optimization method, which we call AngleOPT, to accurately solve the EAP actuators' inverse kinematic problem. Laminated polypyrrole (PPy) EAP actuators are employed to validate the soft robotic kinematic model which has more degrees of freedom than its input. This follows that we have reduced a difficult problem to an easy-to solve inverse kinematic problem (easier to solve) of a hyper-redundant soft robotic system. A parametric estimation model is also proposed to predict the tip coordinates of the actuators for a given voltage. The experimental and numerical results are presented to demonstrate the efficacy of the methodology for estimating the EAP actuators' highly non-linear bending behaviour from the inverse kinematic model. The proposed methodology can be extended to other type of smart structures with a similar topology.},

Aim of review This article intends to provide an overview on the current knowledge on promises and safety concerns of NMN as an anti-aging health product. Key scientific concepts of review Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) levels in the body deplete with aging and it is associated with downregulation of energy production in mitochondria, oxidative stress, DNA damage, cognitive impairment and inflammatory conditions. However, NMN, as the precursor of NAD+, can slow down this process by elevating NAD+ levels in the body. A number of in vivo studies have indicated affirmative results of therapeutic effects for various age-induced complications with NMN supplementation. One preclinical and one clinical study have been conducted to investigate the safety concerns of NMN administration while a few more human clinical trials are being conducted. As there is a large influx of NMN based anti-aging products on the market, proper clinical investigations are urgently needed to find out the effectiveness and safety of NMN supplementation.},

  abstract = {Electrowetting on dielectric is a phenomenon in which the shape and apparent contact angle of a droplet changes when an electric field is applied across the droplet interface. If the field is asymmetric with respect to the droplet, then a net force can be applied to the droplet. In this work, we have measured the electrowetting force by confining the droplet shape beneath a glass plate and measuring the force on the plate. The force was measured as a function of voltage for a range of fluids with different surface energy. Measured forces show excellent agreement with predictions based on the Young\textendash Lippmann equation with measured contact angles. Results also show that the electrowetting force is independent of fluid surface energy below saturation but that the peak force is proportional to the surface tension. This work shows that lowering the surface energy of the fluid can induce larger contact angle change under the same voltage, but it has no beneficial impact on the actuation force in droplet-based actuators. In contrast, velocity tests with deformable droplets show higher speeds for lower surface energy fluids, even above their saturation voltage. However, when the droplet's shape is restrained, the highest velocity is achieved with high surface energy fluids due to the larger electrowetting actuation forces applied.},

  abstract = {We demonstrate bi-directional continuous electrowetting by embedding metal-semiconductor diodes in the electrowetting substrate. Unlike conventional electrowetting on dielectric (EWOD), bidirectional continuous electrowetting uses a single electrode pair to actuate a droplet through long distances. As long as the voltage potential is maintained between two end electrodes, the droplet moves toward the electrode with the higher potential. However, previously reported material systems had limited success in repeated actuation. In this work, diodes based on Schottky barriers were fabricated by forming metal-semiconductor junctions between titanium and high resistivity n-type silicon. The performance enhancements were evaluated using current-voltage measurements of interface pairs. When the titanium is coated with gold to limit electrochemical reactions, the Schottky diodes achieved superior performance compared to electrochemical diodes previously studied. Droplet speed range from 8 mm/s to 240 mm/s is reported. Under repeated actuation, the speed of the droplet showed no degradation for up to 2000 cycles (experiment duration).},

  abstract = {Many optimization problems in computer science have been proven to be NP-hard, and it is unlikely that polynomial-time algorithms that solve these problems exist unless P = NP. Alternatively, they are solved using heuristics algorithms, which provide a sub-optimal solution that, hopefully, is arbitrarily close to the optimal. Such problems are found in a wide range of applications, including artificial intelligence, game theory, graph partitioning, database query optimization, etc. Consider a heuristic algorithm, A. Suppose that A could invoke one of two possible heuristic functions. The question of determining which heuristic function is superior, has typically demanded a yes/no answer\textemdash one which is often substantiated by empirical evidence. In this paper, by using Pattern Classification Techniques (PCT), we propose a formal, rigorous theoretical model that provides a stochastic answer to this problem. We prove that given a heuristic algorithm, A, that could utilize either of two heuristic functions H1 or H2 used to find the solution to a particular problem, if the accuracy of evaluating the cost of the optimal solution by using H1 is greater than the accuracy of evaluating the cost using H2, then H1 has a higher probability than H2 of leading to the optimal solution. This unproven conjecture has been the basis for designing numerous algorithms such as the A* algorithm, and its variants. Apart from formally proving the result, we also address the corresponding database query optimization problem that has been open for at least two decades. To validate our proofs, we report empirical results on database query optimization techniques involving a few well-known histogram estimation methods.},

Herein, we present a numerical model that provides sufficient insights into magnetic particle enrichment in an integrated microfluidic system considering the most possible interactions and forces. The proposed system comprises three distinct interconnected modules: droplet generator, spacer, and splitter with a permanent magnet placed under the splitting zone. Two approaches are developed to predict the particle trajectories inside the droplet, namely, magnetohydrophoretic streamline (static) and multi-particle tracing (dynamic). It is found that although the presence of an external magnetic force may help to improve the separation/enrichment of the magnetic particles in such microfluidic systems, however, the location of the magnet must be carefully determined to avoid the inverse effect of the magnetic field on the separation/enrichment efficiency. Moreover, the full particle enrichment is obtained at a maximum magnetic force to drag force ratio of {$>$}0.8\% and a magnetophoretic velocity to the mean fluid velocity ratio of {$>$}6\% for both 2.83 \textmu m and 4.4 \textmu m magnetic beads. The presented accurate numerical model, together with its unique features of low computational cost and broad applicability, such as separating particles with different properties, can further broaden utility in droplet microfluidics.},

  abstract = {The bilateral filter is a nonlinear filter that smoothes a signal while preserving strong edges. It has demonstrated great effectiveness for a variety of problems in computer vision and computer graphics, and fast versions have been proposed. Unfortunately, little is known about the accuracy of such accelerations. In this paper, we propose a new signal-processing analysis of the bilateral filter which complements the recent studies that analyzed it as a PDE or as a robust statistical estimator. The key to our analysis is to express the filter in a higher-dimensional space where the signal intensity is added to the original domain dimensions. Importantly, this signal-processing perspective allows us to develop a novel bilateral filtering acceleration using downsampling in space and intensity. This affords a principled expression of accuracy in terms of bandwidth and sampling. The bilateral filter can be expressed as linear convolutions in this augmented space followed by two simple nonlinearities. This allows us to derive criteria for downsampling the key operations and achieving important acceleration of the bilateral filter. We show that, for the same running time, our method is more accurate than previous acceleration techniques. Typically, we are able to process a 2 megapixel image using our acceleration technique in less than a second, and have the result be visually similar to the exact computation that takes several tens of minutes. The acceleration is most effective with large spatial kernels. Furthermore, this approach extends naturally to color images and cross bilateral filtering.},

The encapsulated Fe3O4 nanoparticles render the PDM a precise wireless magnetic actuation by means of rotating magnetic fields (RMFs). The increased surface area of the porous PDM facilitates the acoustically induced drug release due to a higher response to the acoustic energy. The drug release profile from the PDM can be selected on command from three different modes, referred to herein as natural, burst, and constant, by differentiating the ultrasound exposure condition. Finally, in vitro test results reveal different therapeutic results for each release mode. The observed great reduction of cancer cell viability in the burst- and constant-release modes confirms that ultrasound with the proposed PDM can enhance the therapeutic effect by increasing drug concentration and sonoporation.},

Liquid metals, which are eutectic alloys of constituent metal atoms with low melting temperatures, are practically useful, but difficult to spread on solid surfaces because of their high surface tension. This makes it difficult to use liquid metals as deformable on-board microcircuitry electrodes, despite their intrinsic deformability. In this study, it is discovered that eutectic gallium\textendash indium (EGaIn) can be spread onto the surface of chemically cross-linked hydrogels consisting of aliphatic alkyl chains with numerous hydroxyl groups (OH), thus facilitating the development of directly micropatterned EGaIn electrodes. More importantly, EGaIn patterned on a hydrogel autonomously reconciliates its surface to form a firm hydrogel interface upon mechanical deformation of the hydrogel. This autonomous surface reconciliation of EGaIn on hydrogels allows researchers to reap the benefits of chemically modified hydrogels, such as reversible stretching, self-healing, and water-swelling capability, thereby facilitating the fabrication of superstretchable, self-healable, and water-swellable liquid-metal electrodes with very high conductance tolerance upon deformation.

This method can be adapted to 3D substrates of various materials without any surface treatment, owing to the intrinsic adhesive and flexible properties of the polymeric masks ensuring conformal contact with non-flat surfaces, and is also expected to be applicable to sub-micron patterns. In addition, a number of highly flexible/stretchable electronic applications, exhibiting no change in electrical conductivity upon consecutive structural deformations, are demonstrated on various substrates including human skin. It is anticipated that these results will not only spur the further development of flexible/stretchable electronics, but also significantly contribute to the innovative on-site fabrication of wearable electronics with high durability.},

Microchannels with dimensions as small as 25 {$\mu$}m are obtained with a maskless, soft lithography process that utilizes direct laser exposure. Change in electrical resistance is measured as a function of the magnitude and area of the surface pressure as well as the cross-sectional geometry, depth and relative lateral position of the embedded channel. These experimentally measured values closely match closed-form theoretical predictions derived from plane strain elasticity and contact mechanics.},

  abstract = {Interest in wearable electronics has led to extensive studies on woven textiles that are mechanically robust and stretchable, have high electrical conductivities, and exhibit fire resistance properties even at high temperatures. We demonstrate a highly easy and scalable method for fabricating defect-free graphene (df G) nacrebased woven electronic textiles (e-textiles) with enhanced flame-retardant properties and high electronic conductivities. The as-prepared graphene shows perfect preservation of its inherent properties without any crystal damage during subsequent exfoliation and noncovalent melamine functionalization. The defect-free graphene functionalized by melamine (m-df G) is well dispersed in various polar solvents. To investigate the synergistic effect of m-df G, quaternary artificial nacre composites are fabricated by adding manganese(II) chloride to a m-df G/ polymer (carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC)) composite. Their mechanical, electrical, and thermal characteristics are then evaluated. The quaternary m-df G-Mn2+-CMC artificial nacre exhibits exceptionally enhanced mechanical properties (tensile strength: 613.9 MPa; toughness: 7.13 MJ m-3) and the best flame retardancy (even at torch heating) as compared to those of graphene oxide/reduced graphene oxide (GO/rGO)-based nacres. In this context, our approach will be helpful to future wearable electronics and fire-retardant textiles with high strength, which can accelerate the commercial viability of e-textiles.},

Going beyond these sub-optimal frameworks, we propose a simple online model named Chained-Tracker (CTracker), which naturally integrates all the three subtasks into an end-to-end solution (the first as far as we know). It chains paired bounding boxes regression results estimated from overlapping nodes, of which each node covers two adjacent frames. The paired regression is made attentive by object-attention (brought by a detection module) and identity-attention (ensured by an ID verification module). The two major novelties: chained structure and paired attentive regression, make CTracker simple, fast and effective, setting new MOTA records on MOT16 and MOT17 challenge datasets (67.6 and 66.6, respectively), without relying on any extra training data. The source code of CTracker can be found at: github.com/pjl1995/CTracker.},

  abstract = {Dielectric elastomer actuators (DEAs) have shown promises in numerous applications such as bio-inspired robotics, tactile displays, tunable optics, and microfluidics, owing to their unique combination of large actuation strain, high energy density, and light weight. However, the practical applications of the DEAs have been hindered partly due to their poor reliability and durability under high-strain actuation. A major failure mechanism is from the localized electrical breakdown. Compliant electrodes with self-clearing capability have been studied to prevent premature failures. Here, an interpenetrating bilayer compliant electrode comprising a thin layer of a water-based polyurethane (WPU) overcoated on an ultrathin single-walled carbon nanotube (SWNT) layer is reported. The thin polyurethane layer serves as the dielectric barrier to suppress corona discharges of the nanotubes in air. The SWNT+WPU bilayer electrode has the capability to self-clear at the breakdown sites, enhancing the fault tolerance and mendability of the DEA at a large-strain actuation. Stable actuation at 150\% area strain for 1000 cycles under square-wave voltage and 5.5-h continuous actuation at a constant voltage have been achieved for acrylic elastomer-based DEAs.},

The magnetic interaction among magnetic particles, magnetic field strength, and concentrations of both magnetic and nonmagnetic particles are considered as key influencing factors in the present work. The results show that chain-like clusters of magnetic particles are formed along the field direction. The size of the clusters increases with increasing magnetic interaction between magnetic particles, while it keeps nearly unchanged as the field strength increases. As the concentration of magnetic particles increases, both the number and size of the clusters increase. Moreover, nonmagnetic particles are found to hinder the migration of magnetic ones. As the concentration of nonmagnetic particles increases, the hindrance on migration of magnetic particles is enhanced.},

He has discussed this in terms of the thermal motions of the liquid, and has suggested that ``the decrease in the adhesive field of force with rising temperature is much less in solids than in liquids and is due principally or wholly to translatory motion''. The implication, however, that the temperature coefficient of the free surface energy of solids is negligible because translatory motions are absent seems to require further justification.},

We also create a software package for a variety of widely used orthogonal moments and evaluate such methods in a same base. The presented theory analysis, software implementation, and evaluation results can support the community, particularly in developing novel techniques and promoting real-world applications.},

The reduced governing ordinary differential equations obtained by using appropriate local similarity transformations are numerically integrated by the help of shooting method. The impact of various emerging parameters on the velocity and temperature fields are graphically displayed for assisting as well as opposing flows.

This work deals exclusively with ceramic suspensions used in the Portuguese ceramic industry, i.e., several Portuguese clays and feldspars, and also suspensions made of mixtures of these two materials. The flow tests conducted showed that, generally, the suspensions had a pseudoplastic character, approaching Newtonian behavior as concentration decreased, although, in some cases, a real plastic behavior was also observed, as in the case of very fine clays with a wide particle size distribution and high solids content. Moreover, it was possible to relate, for each material, both the flow behavior index and the fluid consistency coefficient with the solids concentration and particulate size. As the particle diameter decreases the suspensions become less Newtonian: the flow behavior index decreases and the consistency coefficient increases. A similar trend was detected, for each material, with the increase of solids concentration. However, with the results obtained, it was not yet possible to establish an analytical correlation between those variables, but since the ceramic industry deals with very complex suspensions, additional information on the rheological behavior of the pastes is a step forward to more predictive flow calculations.},

First we propose various improvements to the YOLO detection method, both novel and drawn from prior work. The improved model, YOLOv2, is state-of-the-art on standard detection tasks like PASCAL VOC and COCO. Using a novel, multi-scale training method the same YOLOv2 model can run at varying sizes, offering an easy tradeoff between speed and accuracy. At 67 FPS, YOLOv2 gets 76.8 mAP on VOC 2007. At 40 FPS, YOLOv2 gets 78.6 mAP, outperforming state-of-the-art methods like Faster RCNN with ResNet and SSD while still running significantly faster. Finally we propose a method to jointly train on object detection and classification. Using this method we train YOLO9000 simultaneously on the COCO detection dataset and the ImageNet classification dataset. Our joint training allows YOLO9000 to predict detections for object classes that don't have labelled detection data. We validate our approach on the ImageNet detection task. YOLO9000 gets 19.7 mAP on the ImageNet detection validation set despite only having detection data for 44 of the 200 classes. On the 156 classes not in COCO, YOLO9000 gets 16.0 mAP. But YOLO can detect more than just 200 classes; it predicts detections for more than 9000 different object categories. And it still runs in real-time.},

In contrast to previously reported microswimmers, their motion does not require operation at acoustic pressure nodes, enabling propulsion at low power and far from an ultrasonic transducer. In a megahertz acoustic field, the microswimmers are subject to two predominant forces: the secondary Bjerknes force and a locally generated acoustic streaming propulsive force. The combination of these two forces enables the microswimmers to independently swim on three dimensional boundaries or in free space under magnetical steering.},

This approach shows the ability of inducing concurrent motion of multiple liquid metal droplets using infrared light without complex and bulky systems.           ,                             The controlled actuation of liquid metal (LM) droplets has recently shown great potential in developing smart actuating systems for applications in robotics. However, there is a lack of a simple approach for the precise manipulation of multiple LM droplets in a 2D plane, which hinders the development of complex control over droplets for realizing useful robotic applications. To overcome this challenge, here, a versatile and powerful light-induced manipulation of LM droplets is presented. The key principle is to selectively activate phototransistors in an electrolyte using infrared laser beams to electrically control LM droplets               via               Marangoni forces. This approach shows the ability of inducing concurrent motion, splitting, and merging of multiple LM droplets simply using light without complex and bulky systems. Parameters affecting the manipulation of LM droplets are thoroughly investigated. Moreover, a vehicle carrier driven by wheels composed of multiple LM droplets for making a light-controlled relay is demonstrated. We believe such a light-induced control method for manipulating LM droplets has the potential for advancing the development of future field-programmable robotics and droplet-based soft collaborative robots.},

As the bridge, bioelectrodes should possess both electrical conductivity and adaptive mechanical properties matching the target soft biosystem, but this is still a big challenge. A family of liquid-metal-based magnetoactive slurries (LMMSs) formed by dispersing magnetic iron particles in a Ga-based liquid metal (LM) matrix is reported here. The mechanical properties, viscosity, and stiffness of such materials rapidly respond to the stimulus of an applied magnetic field. By varying the intensity of the magnetic field, regulation within a factor of 1000 of the Young's modulus from {$\approx$}kPa to {$\approx$}MPa, and the ability to reach GPa with more dense iron particles inside the LMMS are demonstrated. With the advantage of high conductivity of the LM matrix, the functions of the LMMS are not only limited to the soft implanted electrodes or penetrating electrodes in biosystems: the electrical response based on the LMMS electrodes can also be precisely tuned by simply regulating the applied magnetic field.},

  abstract = {The functionalities of the untethered miniature swimming robots significantly decrease as the robot size becomes smaller, due to limitations of feasible miniaturized on-board components. Here we propose an untethered jellyfish-inspired soft millirobot that could realize multiple functionalities in moderate Reynolds number by producing diverse controlled fluidic flows around its body using its magnetic composite elastomer lappets, which are actuated by an external oscillating magnetic field. We particularly investigate the interaction between the robot's soft body and incurred fluidic flows due to the robot's body motion, and utilize such physical interaction to achieve different predation-inspired object manipulation tasks. The proposed lappet kinematics can inspire other existing jellyfish-like robots to achieve similar functionalities at the same length and time scale. Moreover, the robotic platform could be used to study the impacts of the morphology and kinematics changing in ephyra jellyfish.},

  abstract = {Dielectric elastomer actuators (DEAs) are flexible lightweight actuators that can generate strains of over 100 \%. They are used in applications ranging from haptic feedback (mm-sized devices), to cm-scale soft robots, to meter-long blimps. DEAs consist of an electrode-elastomerelectrode stack, placed on a frame. Applying a voltage between the electrodes electrostatically compresses the elastomer, which deforms in-plane or out-of plane depending on design. Since the electrodes are bonded to the elastomer, they must reliably sustain repeated very large deformations while remaining conductive, and without significantly adding to the stiffness of the soft elastomer. The electrodes are required for electrostatic actuation, but also enable resistive and capacitive sensing of the strain, leading to self-sensing actuators. This review compares the different technologies used to make compliant electrodes for DEAs in terms of: impact on DEA device performance (speed, efficiency, maximum strain), manufacturability, miniaturization, the integration of self-sensing and self-switching, and compatibility with low-voltage operation. While graphite and carbon black have been the most widely used technique in research environments, alternative methods are emerging which combine compliance, conduction at over 100 \% strain with better conductivity and/or ease of patternability, including microfabrication-based approaches for compliant metal thin-films, metal-polymer nano-composites, nanoparticle implantation, and reel-to-reel production of \textmu m-scale patterned thin films on elastomers. Such electrodes are key to miniaturization, low-voltage operation, and widespread commercialization of DEAs.},

  abstract = {Digital microfluidics is an elegant technique based on single droplets for the design, composition, and manipulation of microfluidic systems. In digital microfluidics, especially in the electrowetting on dielectric (EWOD) system, each droplet acts as an independent reactor, which enables a wide range of multiple parallel biological and chemical reactions at the microscale. EWOD digital microfluidics reduces reagent and energy consumption, accelerates analysis, enables point-of-care diagnostic, simplifies integration with sensors, etc. Such a digital microfluidic system is especially relevant for droplet digital PCR (ddPCR), thanks to its nanoliter droplets and well-controlled volume distribution. At low DNA concentration, these small volumes allow less than one DNA strand per droplet on average (limited dilution) so that after a fixed number of PCR cycles (endpoint PCR), only the DNA in droplets containing the sequence of interest has been amplified and can be detected by fluorescence to yield an accurate count of the sequences of interest using statistical models. Focusing on ddPCR, this article summarizes the latest development and research on EWOD technology for droplet PCR over the last decade.},

One approach to achieving programmability is the controlled sequential wetting and dewetting on a surface using voltage actuation. In particular, liquid dielectrophoresis techniques have recently been shown to provide the ability to form a spread liquid film on a normally liquid repellent, but rigid, substrate via applying a spatially periodic electrical potential underneath an initial sessile droplet. In this work, we demonstrate the creation of thin, rectangular shaped, films of electrically insulating liquid on the side of a curved and flexible liquid repellant substrate using dielectrophoresis forces. We find that the experimental threshold voltage  {$\mathsl{V}$} T ( {$\mathsl{K}$} s ) VT({$\kappa$}s)  for film formation has a monotonic dependence on the value of the substrate curvature  {$\mathsl{K}$} s {$\kappa$}s  in the range -0.4\,mm-1 {$<$}  {$\mathsl{K}$} s {$\kappa$}s \,{$<$}\,0.26\,mm-1. By considering the balance of stresses acting on the films, including the Laplace pressure and the Maxwell stress, we develop an analytical theoretical expression that is in excellent quantitative agreement with our curvature dependent experimental threshold voltage measurements. The resulting physical insights and the demonstration of programmable wettability on curved and flexible substrates with both positive and negative curvature provide the foundations for applications in imaging, displays, and biochemical analysis.},

The pumps are located in the upstream areas of the merging point of the flow channel, and the mixer is located in its downstream area. Additionally, the flow actuators have interdigital transducers (IDTs) to generate the SAWs. The IDTs were fabricated by patterning Al/Cr on a LiNbO3 substrate, and the flow channel wall was made of the epoxy-based negative resist SU-8. Using the mixing chip, we carried out a mixing experiment with two water solutions of different concentrations using glycerin, and a chemical reaction experiment involving luminol luminescence. Through the experiments, it was found that local and rapid mixing of a continuous liquid flow was possible by using the SAW actuators, and the capability of our fabricated mixing chip as a reactor was demonstrated. \textcopyright{} 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

We also fabricated a continuous liquid flow actuator consisting of both an IDT and a flow channel made of epoxy-based negative resist SU-8 on one chip. To diversify the liquids used, we created an actuator design in which the IDT and liquid do not directly touch one another at the partition wall. Using this chip, we succeeded in creating a continuous flow of liquid using the SAWs. When 160 mW of electric power was applied, the liquid flow rate of the actuator was approximately 7.8 {$\mu$}L/s.

Additionally, investigation of the pH of feed solution, extractant concentration, agitating speed, the ratio of emulsion to the external phase (EM/E), initial lead (Pb) concentration, and contact time were carried out. The results confirmed the existence of co-stabilization strategy, which leads to the stability of the emulsion and improvement in the extraction efficiency of lead ions (Pb) to 97.2\% after 8.0 min of mixing time under best-operating conditions with 0.3\% membrane breakage.},

  abstract = {In order to apply the multi-particle collision dynamics (MPCD) method to a magnetic particle suspension, we have elucidated the dependence of the translational and rotational Brownian motion of magnetic particles on the MPCD parameters that characterize the MPCD simulation method. We here consider a two-dimensional system composed of magnetic spherical particles in thermodynamic equilibrium. The diffuse reflection model has been employed for treating the interactions between fluid and magnetic particles. In the diffuse reflection model, the interactions between fluid and magnetic particles are transferred into the translational motion more strongly than into the rotational motion of magnetic particles. The employment of relatively small simulation time steps gives rise to a satisfactory level of the translational Brownian motion. The activation level of the Brownian motion is almost independent of both the size of the unit collision cell and the number of fluid particles per cell. Larger values of the maximum rotation angle induce stronger translational and rotational Brownian motion, but in the present magnetic particle suspension the range between around {$\pi$}/4 and {$\pi$}/2 seems to be reasonable. We may conclude that the MPCD method with the simple diffuse reflection model is a feasible simulation technique as the first approximation for analyzing the behavior of magnetic particles in a suspension. If more accurate solutions regarding the aggregate structures of magnetic particles are required, the introduction of the scaling coefficient regarding the interactions between fluid and magnetic particles can yield more accurate and physically reasonable aggregate structures in both a qualitative and quantitative meanings.},

  abstract = {Magnetic particle suspensions have a great potential as an application in engineering fields and therefore a variety of studies on these functional fluid have been conducted in various fields, including the traditional fluid engineering field and the recent bioengineering field such as an application to a drug delivery system. The main application target in the fluid engineering field may be mechanical dampers and actuators. Magneto-rheological properties significantly depend on the formation of aggregates of magnetic particles. In the present study, we focus on a ferromagnetic rod-like particle suspension to discuss the phase change of aggregate structures of magnetic rod-like particles and the magneto-rheological properties that are strongly dependent on the formation of aggregate structures. The characteristics of the phase change are mainly investigated by Monte Carlo simulations for thermodynamic equilibrium and the magneto-rheological properties are done by Brownian dynamics simulations in a simple shear flow situation. From the latter simulations, we discuss mainly the dependence of the magneto-rheological effect on the phase change of aggregate structures. In a weak applied magnetic field, magnetic rod-like particles tend to aggregate to form raft-like clusters if the magnetic particle-particle interaction is much stronger than thermal energy. If the magnetic field strength is increased, these raft-like clusters drastically dissociate into single-moving particles at a certain value of the magnetic field strength, that is, the phase change in aggregate structures arises. The net viscosity and viscosity components exhibit complex dependence on the magnetic field strength, which is mainly due to the raft-like cluster formation of magnetic particles.},

We found that the SWNT content can be increased up to 20 weight percent without reducing the mechanical flexibility or softness of the copolymer. The SWNT composite film was coated with dimethyl-siloxane\textendash based rubber, which exhibited a conductivity of 57 siemens per centimeter and a stretchability of 134\%. Further, the elastic conductor was integrated with printed organic transistors to fabricate a rubberlike active matrix with an effective area of 20 by 20 square centimeters. The active matrix sheet can be uniaxially and biaxially stretched by 70\% without mechanical or electrical damage.

The design principle is based on the antagonistic arrangement of circular and longitudinal muscle groups of Oligochaetes. Sequential antagonistic motion is achieved in a flexible braided mesh-tube structure using a nickel titanium (NiTi) coil actuators wrapped in a spiral pattern around the circumference. An enhanced theoretical model of the NiTi coil spring describes the combination of martensite deformation and spring elasticity as a function of geometry. A numerical model of the mesh structures reveals how peristaltic actuation induces robust locomotion and details the deformation by the contraction of circumferential NiTi actuators. Several peristaltic locomotion modes are modeled, tested, and compared on the basis of speed. Utilizing additional NiTi coils placed longitudinally, steering capabilities are incorporated. Proprioceptive potentiometers sense segment contraction, which enables the development of closed-loop controllers. Several appropriate control algorithms are designed and experimentally compared based on locomotion speed and energy consumption. The entire mechanical structure is made of flexible mesh materials and can withstand significant external impact during operation. This approach allows a completely soft robotic platform by employing a flexible control unit and energy sources.},

This study proposes a fiber-shaped DEA, namely dielectric elastomer fiber actuators (DEFAs). The actuator consisted of a silicone tube filled with the aqueous electrode (sodium chloride solution). Furthermore, it could generate linear and bending actuation in a water environment, which acts as the ground side electrode. Linear-type DEFA and bending-type DEFA were fabricated and characterized to prove the concept. A mixture of Ecoflex 00\textendash 30 (Smooth-On) and Sylgard 184 (Dow Corning) was employed in these actuators for the tube part, which was 75.0-mm long with outer and inner diameters of 6.0 mm and 5.0 mm, respectively. An analytical model was constructed to design and predict the behavior of the devices. In the experiments, the linear-type DEFA exhibited an actuation strain and force of 1.3\% and 42.4 mN, respectively, at 10 kV (\textasciitilde 20 V/\textmu m) with a response time of 0.2 s. The bending-type DEFA exhibited an actuation angle of 8.1{$\smwhtcircle$} at 10 kV (\textasciitilde 20 V/\textmu m). Subsequently, a jellyfish-type robot was developed and tested, which showed the swimming speed of 3.1 mm/s at 10 kV and the driving frequency of 4 Hz. The results obtained in this study show the successful implementation of the actuator concept and demonstrate its applicability for soft robotics.},

  abstract = {Dielectric elastomer actuators (DEAs) are a promising actuator technology for soft robotics. As a configuration of this technology, stacked DEAs afford a muscle-like contraction that is useful to build soft robotic systems. In stacked DEAs, dielectric and electrode layers are alternately stacked. Thus, often a dedicated setup with complicated processes or sometimes laborious manual stacking of the layers is required to fabricate stacked actuators. In this study, we propose a method to monolithically fabricate stacked DEAs without alternately stacking the dielectric and electrode layers. In this method, the actuators are fabricated mainly through two steps: 1) molding of an elastomeric matrix containing free-form microfluidic channels and 2) injection of a liquid conductive material that acts as an electrode. The feasibility of our method is investigated via the fabrication and characterization of simple monolithic DEAs with multiple electrodes (2, 4, and 10). The fabricated actuators are characterized in terms of actuation stroke, output force, and frequency response. In the actuators, polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and eutectic gallium\textendash indium (EGaIn) are used for the elastomeric matrix and electrode material, respectively. Microfluidic channels are realized by dissolving a three-dimensional printed part suspended in the elastomeric structure. The experimental results show the successful implementation of the proposed method and the good agreement between the measured data and theoretical predication, validating the feasibility of the proposed method.},

Herein, we demonstrate a design idea based on Fowler-Nordheim tunnelling effect for fabrication of pressure sensors with ultrahigh sensitivity and sensing density by spin-coating extremely low urchin-like hollow carbon spheres (less than 1.5 wt.\%) dispersed in polydimethylsiloxane, which is distinct from the current transduction mechanisms. This sensor exhibits an ultrahigh sensitivity of 260.3 kPa               -1               at 1\,Pa, a proof-of-concept demonstration of a high sensing density of 400\,cm               -2               , high transparency and temperature noninterference. In addition, it can be fabricated by an industrially viable and scalable spin-coating method, providing an efficient avenue for realizing large-scale production and application of ultrahigh sensitivity flexible pressure sensors on various surfaces and in in vivo environments.},

  abstract = {Artificial muscles possess a vast potential in accelerating the development of robotics, exoskeletons, and prosthetics. Although a variety of emerging actuator technologies are reported, they suffer from several issues, such as high driving voltages, large hysteresis, and water intolerance. Here, a liquid metal artificial muscle (LMAM) is demonstrated, based on the electrochemically tunable interfacial tension of liquid metal to mimic the contraction and extension of muscles. The LMAM can work in different solutions with a wide range of pH (0\textendash 14), generating actuation strains of up to 87\% at a maximum extension speed of 15 mm s-1. More importantly, the LMAM only needs a very low driving voltage of 0.5 V. The actuating components of the LMAM are completely built from liquids, which avoids mechanical fatigue and provides actuator linkages without mechanical constraints to movement. The LMAM is used for developing several proof-of-concept applications, including controlled displays, cargo deliveries, and reconfigurable optical reflectors. The simplicity, versatility, and efficiency of the LMAM are further demonstrated by using it to actuate the caudal fin of an untethered bionic robotic fish. The presented LMAM has the potential to extend the performance space of soft actuators for applications from engineering fields to biomedical applications.},

Therefore, it is essential to advance the PI of human-made agents as much as possible, in addition to their CI, to operate them in unstructured and complex real-world environments like the biological agents. This article gives a perspective on what PI paradigm is, when PI can be more significant and dominant in physical and biological agents at different length scales and how bioinspired and abstract PI methods can be created in agent bodies. PI paradigm aims to synergize and merge many research fields, such as mechanics, materials science, robotics, mechanical design, fluidics, active matter, biology, self-assembly and collective systems, to enable advanced PI capabilities in human-made agent bodies, comparable to the ones observed in biological organisms. Such capabilities would progress the future robots and other machines beyond what can be realized using the current frameworks.},

Since the hydrodynamics of process suspension flow behavior is strongly influenced by the suspension rheology, it is essential to accommodate the suspension rheology in any hydrodynamic modeling of the suspension's flow behavior. The objective of this article is to present the overarching modeling approach developed and to compare this with empirical suspension hydrodynamic behavior over wide ranges of fluid properties and applications. The relevant literature is reviewed, and the inability of dimensional analysis to accommodate the common yield stress rheological models applicable to industrial suspensions is discussed. This approach is evaluated in the context of hydrodynamics problems relevant to the process industry: straight pipe flow, energy losses in pipe fittings and valves, free surface flows, and centrifugal pump derating. Comparison with experimental data shows that this generic modeling approach leads to accurate establishment of dynamic similarity, which is a fundamental precursor to efficient engineering design for the process industry.},

E-textiles can also more easily adapt to fast changes in the computational and sensing requirements of any specific application, this one representing a useful feature for power management and context awareness. The vision behind wearable computing foresees future electronic systems to be an integral part of our everyday outfits. Such electronic devices have to meet special requirements concerning wearability. Wearable systems will be characterized by their ability to automatically recognize the activity and the behavioral status of their own user as well as of the situation around her/him, and to use this information to adjust the systems' configuration and functionality. This review focuses on recent advances in the field of Smart Textiles and pays particular attention to the materials and their manufacturing process. Each technique shows advantages and disadvantages and our aim is to highlight a possible trade-off between flexibility, ergonomics, low power consumption, integration and eventually autonomy.},

TransTrack leverages the transformer architecture, which is an attention-based query-key mechanism. It applies object features from the previous frame as a query of the current frame and introduces a set of learned object queries to enable detecting new-coming objects. It builds up a novel joint-detection-and-tracking paradigm by accomplishing object detection and object association in a single shot, simplifying complicated multi-step settings in tracking-by-detection methods. On MOT17 and MOT20 benchmark, TransTrack achieves 74.5\% and 64.5\% MOTA, respectively, competitive to the state-of-the-art methods. We expect TransTrack to provide a novel perspective for multiple object tracking. The code is available at: https: //github.com/PeizeSun/TransTrack.},

  abstract = {Traditional cell/particle isolation methods are time-consuming and expensive and can lead to morphology dis\- ruptions due to high induced shear stress. To address these problems, novel lab-on-a-chip-based purification methods have been employed. Among various methods introduced for the separation and purification of cells and synthetics particles, acoustofluidics has been one of the most effective methods. Unlike traditional separation techniques carried out in clinical laboratories based on chemical properties, the acoustofluidic process relies on the physical properties of the sample. Using acoustofluidics, manipulating cells and particles can be achieved in a label-free, contact-free, and highly biocompatible manner. To optimize the functionality of the platform, the numerical study should be taken into account before conducting experimental tests to save time and reduce fabrication expenses. Most current numerical studies have only considered one-dimensional harmonic standing waves to simulate the acoustic pressure distribution. However, one-dimensional simulations cannot calculate the actual acoustic pressure distribution inside the microchannel due to its limitation in considering longitudinal waves. To address this limitation, a two-dimensional numerical simulation was conducted in this study. Our numerical simulation investigates the effects of the platform geometrical and operational conditions on the separation efficiency. Next, the optimal values are tested in an experimental setting to validate these optimal parameters and conditions. This work provides a guideline for future acoustofluidic chip designs with a high degree of reproducibility and efficiency.},

The films from THF had an asymmetric cross-sectional view, in which CR-U large sphere dispersed with a thin skin layer of PDMS on one side. On the other hand, the films from ACT had a symmetric cross-sectional structure, in which CR-U small sphere dispersed uniformly without a PDMS thin skin layer. By applying DC electric field, the films from THF deformed by expanding the thin skin layer regardless of the electric field polarity. The films from ACT showed almost no deformation.

The actuator is designed and optimized under the guidance of a corresponding electromechanical model. Then, the flow field characteristics of the synthetic jet actuator are simulated and analyzed. Equipped with the actuator, the bioinspired robot can locomote either with a speed of 0.66 body length per second on the surface of the water by jetting air or with a speed of 0.43 body length per second while almost completely submerged underwater by jetting water. The jet actuator presents even more environmental adaptability, which powers dual swimming locomotion by jetting two flow media, and can potentially be applied to the design of underwater robots.},

The theory behind the operation of this actuator is developed and validated via a series of experiments.

In this work, the generation of robust nanoscale force gradients is demonstrated using MHz driving frequencies via acoustic-structure interactions. A structured elastic layer at the interface between a microfluidic channel and a traveling surface acoustic wave (SAW) device results in submicron acoustic traps, each of which can trap individual submicron particles. The acoustically driven deformation of nanocavities gives rise to time-averaged acoustic fields which direct suspended particles toward, and trap them within, the nanocavities. The use of SAWs permits massively multiplexed particle manipulation with deterministic patterning at the single-particle level. In this work, 300 nm diameter particles are acoustically trapped in 500 nm diameter cavities using traveling SAWs with wavelengths in the range of 20\textendash 80 \textmu m with one particle per cavity. On-demand generation of nanoscale acoustic force gradients has wide applications in nanoparticle manipulation, including bioparticle enrichment and enhanced catalytic reactions for industrial applications.},

  abstract = {This work examines the important role of light power absorbed by TiO2 on the photocatalytic degradation of dichloroacetic acid (DCA) in a semi-continuous slurry photoreactor with UV\textendash Vis radiation. This system is an excellent model for understanding the light matter interaction, because DCA is transparent and the acid pH of the solution prevents the formation of large TiO2 aggregates. Under these conditions, the light power absorbed by four different commercial Titania photocatalysts, along the whole volume of the reactor, has been quantitatively calculated by assuming a Mie scattering model on a distribution of different particle sizes. Although the different chemical nature of the four considered samples (three of them provided by the Evonik Company, P25, P25/20 and P90, together with Hombikat UV 100), and the different catalytic efficiency based on weight, we have found that all the catalytic responses are fundamentally controlled by the absorbed radiation in the four samples. Therefore, in the studied samples, any difference in the catalytic behavior is only due to the light-matter interaction being of lesser importance other mechanisms, as space-charge blocking.},

It combines gray levels or colors based on both their geometric closeness and their photometric similariv, and prefers near values to distant values in both domain and range. In contrast with filters that operate on the three bands of a color image separately, a bilateral filter can enforce the perceptual metric underlying the CIE-Lab color space, and smooth colors and preserve edges in a way that is tuned to human perception. Also, in contrast with standardjltering, bilateral filtering produces no phantom colors along edges in color images, and reduces phantom colors where they appear in the original image.},

At low voltage, we observe the expected variation, but for high voltage, the electrowetting saturates, with other polymer films. In the case of PET, the increase in wettability is irreversible but only as a result of modification of the polymer at the edge of the drop, near the three-phase contact line, where the electric field is high and inhomogeneous. At very high fields, we observe that the liquid contour becomes unstable, the liquid drop expelling little droplets around it. We investigate the influence of the composition of the aqueous solution with simple solutes as well as water soluble polymers. In all these cases, the electrowetting effect can help the solutions to wet the solid surface.},

Up to which point can an electric voltage decrease the contact angle? The first limitation comes when using pure water, above a threshold voltage, little droplets are emitted at the perimeter of the mother drop. We present an analysis of the drop contour line stability, involving competition between electrostatic and capillary forces, which is compatible with observations. The use of salted water solutions suppresses this instability, then one faces a second limitation: the evolution of the contact angle saturates before complete wetting. We show that this saturation is caused by ionisation of the air in the vicinity of the drop edge. We analyse the luminescence induced by gas ionization and measure the related electrical discharges. We explain how air ionization suppresses the driving force for electrowetting and how it induces the formation of an hydrophillic ring around the drop.},

  abstract = {In this study the response of dry convective boundary layers to nonstationary surface heat fluxes is systematically investigated. This is relevant not only during sunset and sunrise but also, for example, when clouds modulate incoming solar radiation. Because the time scale of the associated change in surface heat fluxes may differ from case to case, the authors consider the generic situation of oscillatory surface heat fluxes with different frequencies and amplitudes and study the response of the boundary layer in terms of transfer functions. To this end both a mixed layer model (MLM) and a large-eddy simulation (LES) model are used; the latter is used to evaluate the predictive quality of the mixed layer model. The mixed layer model performs generally quite well for slow changes in the surface heat flux and provides analytical understanding of the transfer characteristics of the boundary layer such as amplitude and phase lag. For rapidly changing surface fluxes (i.e., changes within a time frame comparable to the large eddy turnover time), it proves important to account for the time it takes for the information to travel from the surface to higher levels of the boundary layer such as the inversion zone. As a follow-up to a 1997 study by Sorbjan, who showed that the conventional convective velocity scale is inadequate as a scaling quantity during the decay phase, this paper addresses the issue of defining, in (generic) transitional situations, a velocity scale that is solely based on the surface heat flux and its history.},

Although many groups all over the world have contributed considerably to solve the scientific challenges involved, the reasons why only some trisiloxane surfactants promote superspreading, whereas others of similar chemical structure behave more like ordinary surfactants, has remained a mystery up to now. A number of original papers and reviews on superspreading have been published in recent years. The driving force still proposed today is most often Marangoni flow. This is, however, in contradiction with recent results showing that superspreading only starts after a surface tension gradient between apex and leading edge has been eliminated. From foam film experiments unrelated to wetting, there is evidence for ``dangling'' bilayers attached to the air/water interface only in case of the superspreading trisiloxane surfactants. By combining this and other published experimental findings, a new hypothesis of the mode of action is put forward: Advancing by ``rolling action'' at the leading edge, and the supply of surfactant by ``unzippering'' of the dangling bilayers all over the surface of the drop; this hypothesis even fulfills basic thermodynamic requirements.},

Commercially available loteprednol etabonate and brinzolamide ophthalmic suspensions were used as model suspensions. The impact of excipients in these formulations on the LD measurements was determined using a one-factor-at-a-time experimental design approach, using National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) traceable polystyrene particle size standards as references. Among the evaluated excipients, polymers containing polyacrylic acid were found to interfere with the PSD analysis by creating the LD signals correspond to particles ranging from a few micrometers to a hundred micrometers in size. As a result, the measured PSD of active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) particles in the formulation overlapped with or superimposed on the excipient PSD signal, leading to erroneous interpretation of the API particle size. Additionally, dispersion of brinzolamide particles in unsaturated solutions led to rapid dissolution of brinzolamide particles during the measurement, resulting in underestimation of the particle size range. Here, a placebo background subtraction approach was developed to eliminate the interference of the excipients. This newly developed LD method was also evaluated using orthogonal methods, including polarized light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The strategy used in this study to eliminate the interference of excipients may also be useful for other heterogeneous dispersions where excipient interference may be of concern.},

Towards this end, true random numbers generated from physical sources are highly required for guaranteeing security of encryption and decryption schemes for exchanging sensitive information. However, majority of true random number generators (TRNGs) are mechanically rigid, and thus cannot be compatibly integrated with some specific flexible platforms. Herein, we present a flexible and stretchable bionic TRNG inspired by the uniqueness and randomness of biological architectures. The flexible TRNG film is molded from the surface microstructures of natural plants (e.g., ginkgo leaf) via a simple, low-cost, and environmentally friendly manufacturing process. In our proof-of-principle experiment, the TRNG exhibits a fast generation speed of up to 1.04 Gbit/s, in which random numbers are fully extracted from laser speckle patterns with a high extraction rate of 72\%. Significantly, the resulting random bit streams successfully pass all randomness test suites including NIST, TestU01, and DIEHARDER. Even after 10,000 times cyclic stretching or bending tests, or during temperature shock (-25\textendash 80 \textdegree C), the bionic TRNG still reveals robust mechanical reliability and thermal stability. Such a flexible TRNG shows a promising potential in information security of emerging flexible networked electronics.},

  abstract = {High-efficiency transfer of nanowire percolating films into a PDMS polymer matrix was demonstrated to achieve stretchable and transparent photodetectors.           ,                             Stretchable devices with good transparency offer exciting new applications over the existing technologies, but remarkable difficulties remain in the fabrication of transparent and stretchable devices. In this paper, we report an effective method to fabricate transparent elastic photodetectors which combines the merits of the transparent polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) polymer with its stretchability and the Zn               2               SnO               4               nanowire (NW) with its photodetection functionality. Zonyl fluorosurfactant is found to be critical which improves the bonding between the functional NWs and the PDMS matrix, thus enabling the high efficient transfer of NW structures into PDMS. Highly conductive and thin percolating AgNW films were successfully embedded into PDMS mixed with {$\sim$}11\% Zonyl which are otherwise not achievable with pure PDMS. Transparent and stretchable photodetectors were fabricated with the developed method. The photocurrent was found to be reciprocal to the square of the channel length,               I               ph               {$\sim$} 1/               l               2               . The chemically bonded sensing materials in the PDMS matrix allow more NW exposure to air. This lead to a fast switching operation of the photodetectors with a response time below 0.8 s and a reset time around 3 s, which is significantly improved compared to reported stretchable NW photodetectors fully embedded in the polymer matrix.},

  abstract = {随着电子信息技术的飞速发展,环境刺激响应性智能材料应运而生并逐渐向智能化、柔性可穿戴以及多功能集成化方向发展。柔性驱动器作为智能材料的重要分支,在保留智能材料对外界环境刺激快速响应性的同时还要满足大尺度弯曲变形性、优异的循环稳定性以及多重刺激响应性,在康复理疗、智能开关、人工肌肉以及柔性机器人等新兴领域有着广泛的应用前景。当前报道的一些柔性驱动器存在各种各样的问题,包括:制备工艺复杂、成本高、环境污染大、驱动器性能不稳定、刺激源苛刻、刺激选择性单一等,要满足当前对柔性驱动器具有高柔性、快速及多重刺激响应性、大尺度弯曲变形性、优异的循环稳定性、驱动过程环保安全无污染的高标准、高要求还有一定距离,这大大限制了柔性驱动器在未来新兴智能化体系中的应用及发展。因此,选择一些环境友好型材料、采用简单便捷的加工方法制备出具有多重刺激响应性的柔性驱动器势在必行。本论文综述了智能材料以及柔性驱动材料的发展过程,详细阐述了目前集中研究的一些柔性驱动材料,及不同刺激响应性柔性驱动器的制备及应用研究现状。论文中从一些能够对环境中的光、热、湿气等刺激迅速感知并产生响应行为的新型功能材料出发,在不改变材料基本性能的同时,通过物理共混或结构组装等方法赋予驱动器多重刺激响应性;接着,利用传统的湿法纺丝工艺以及旋涂成膜法制备了具有高柔性的一维纤维以及二维薄膜基驱动器;最后经过创新性的设计,将其应用在仿生驱动以及智能控制器件中,在未来的智能机器人以及智能操控领域具有较大的应用前景。全文结论如下:（1）以天然的海藻酸钠为原料,采用湿法纺丝工艺制备了海藻酸钠纤维,通过对纤维的力学性能进行分析表征得出,当海藻酸钠纺丝液的浓度为4.0 wt\%,氯化钙凝固浴的浓度为4.0 wt\%时,海藻酸钠纤维具有最佳的力学强度。此外,采用定向加捻操作使海藻酸钠纤维在凝胶态下发生物理结构取向变形,得到捻数、长度可控的扭转结构海藻酸钠纤维。由于定向加捻操作只改变了纤维的物理形态,并不影响其化学结构,所制得的扭转结构海藻酸钠纤维依然具有优异的吸湿性,可以在外界水刺激下发生快速的吸湿溶胀行为。重点研究了海藻酸钠凝胶纤维直径、股数对纤维加捻极限的影响,扭转纤维捻数对纤维吸湿溶胀性、结晶度以及取向度的影响。结果表明:随着海藻酸钠凝胶纤维直径以及股数（根数）的增加,扭转纤维的捻回角不断增大,其加捻极限不断减小,即凝胶纤维越粗,所获得的加捻数越少。随着扭转纤维中捻回数的增加,纤维表面微纳米级缝隙逐渐增多,粗糙度不断增大,这大大提高了纤维的吸湿溶胀性以及水分子在纤维表面的吸附-解吸速率。另外,捻回数的增加使纤维的力学强度以及取向度大幅提升,但对纤维结晶度的影响不大。（2）通过湿法纺丝以及定向加捻操作制得不同长度以及捻数的扭转结构的海藻酸钠纤维。受吸湿溶胀以及去湿收缩特性的影响,该扭转纤维在外界水以及湿气刺激下能够产生快速、可逆的旋转运动行为。重点研究了扭转纤维在水刺激下的驱动机理,用红外光谱仪跟踪记录了纤维在重水刺激过程的微观结构变化,发现重水刺激前后引起纤维中氢键的建立与破坏,从而产生快速、可逆的吸附-解吸附行为以及纤维体积上的溶胀-解溶胀,最后在溶胀-收缩力的作用下促使扭转纤维产生快速可逆的旋转运动行为。接着研究了扭转纤维在水、湿气刺激下的驱动性能,测试结果表明:随着捻数以及长度的增加,扭转纤维的旋转圈数以及旋转速度均大幅提高,其最高旋转速度高达13000转/分钟,单次最高旋转圈数高达420圈。对比水和湿气刺激下的旋转运动行为可以看出:在解捻性旋转运动过程中,扭转纤维在水刺激下的旋转速度远大于湿气刺激过程,而回复性旋转运动过程完全相反,这是因为水相比蒸汽而言能够使扭转纤维更快溶胀从而产生较快的解捻速度,而蒸汽相比水能够快速挥发从而产生较快的回复速度。此外,在旋转运动过程中扭转纤维不断的将水刺激转化为机械能输出,其最大动能（Ek）输出高达1.48\texttimes 10\textasciitilde 4 W/kg,重力势能（Ep）做功高达6.47\texttimes 10\textasciitilde 2 W/kg。并且扭转纤维在连续400次的循环水刺激下依然具有非常优异的循环稳定性。最后,通过对扭转纤维进行设计组装制备成``水力发电机''、``智能窗帘''、``呼吸织物''以及``智能起重机'',实现了在智能控制器以及智能纺织服装领域中的潜在应用。（3）将具有优异的光热以及吸湿性的GO与海藻酸钠复合制备成混合纺丝液,通过湿法纺丝以及定向加捻操作得到扭转结构的GO/SA复合纤维。GO的加入赋予复合纤维两方面的突出优势:其一,亲水性的GO与水溶性的海藻酸钠在水中能够形成均一稳定的混合纺丝液。其二,GO的加入不仅没有降低扭转结构GO/SA复合纤维的吸湿溶胀特性,同时赋予其优异的光热响应性,使该扭转结构的复合纤维能够在外界光照以及湿气刺激下产生快速、可逆且稳定的旋转运动行为。重点研究了扭转纤维在红外光照以及湿气刺激下的驱动机理,在近红外光照下,水分子在复合纤维与环境中发生可逆性的解吸-吸附行为,从而产生可逆的收缩-溶胀力,促使纤维产生可逆的加捻-回复性旋转运动。在湿气刺激下的驱动机理同（2）中解释一样,是由于水分子在复合纤维中的吸附-解吸附行为导致纤维体积的溶胀-解溶胀,从而产生可逆的解捻-回复性旋转运动行为。驱动性能测试结果表明:随着GO含量的增加,扭转结构GO/SA复合纤维的在红外光照以及湿气刺激下的旋转速度、旋转圈数均大幅上升,这主要是由于GO的加入增加了复合纤维表面的粗糙度以及疏松程度,加快了水分子在纤维上的吸附-解吸速率。此外,通过施加稳定的高-低湿气刺激,该扭转结构GO/SA复合纤维能够产生高达5 MPa的驱动应力,远大于哺乳动物骨骼肌的收缩力。该扭转结构GO/SA复合纤维优异的驱动性、可逆收缩性以及灵活可编织性可以被应用在智能网、远程控制器以及智能吊桥等领域。（4）采用溶液蒸发成膜法以及旋涂成膜法分别制得GO膜和CNT/PDMS复合膜,然后采用二次固化成膜法将GO层与CNT/PDMS层复合得到GO-CNT/PDMS双层复合薄膜。由于GO自身优异的吸湿性以及CNT优异的光热性,该复合薄膜能够在外界红外光照、温度以及湿度刺激下发生快速、可逆、稳定的双向弯曲变形行为。驱动机理解释如下:光热刺激过程,CNT/PDMS层中的CNT快速吸热导致PDMS受热膨胀,CNT/PDMS层产生较大的膨胀力;此时温度上升导致GO层间的水分子快速增发,GO层体积收缩,产生较大的收缩力,最后在膨胀力与收缩力的协同作用下GO-CNT/PDMS双层复合薄膜快速向GO层一侧发生弯曲变形行为。湿气刺激下,CNT/PDMS层的疏水性导致其基本不受环境湿气影响,而GO层优异的亲水性导致水分子快速进入GO片层之间,GO层体积快速膨胀,最后在GO层溶胀力的作用下GO-CNT/PDMS双层复合薄膜向CNT/PDMS层一侧发生快速的弯曲变形行为。进一步的驱动性能测试表明:随着复合薄膜中CNT含量以及光照强度的增加,复合薄膜向GO层一侧的弯曲角度以及响应速度均大幅提高。当CNT含量为5 wt\%,光照强度为0.5 W/cm\textasciitilde 2时,复合薄膜在2.48 s便可达到最大弯曲角度90\textdegree,且经过180次的连续性弯曲-回复形变测试,薄膜依然具有稳定的驱动性能。另外,通过直接改变复合薄膜的接触温度,使得薄膜的驱动变形更快,当外界温度达到80\textcelsius 时,薄膜在1.72 s便可达到最大弯曲角度180\textdegree 。接着,控制环境温度不变逐渐增加相对湿度,复合薄膜会向CNT/PDMS层一侧发生逐渐递增式的弯曲变形行为。当环境湿度达到90\%时,复合薄膜可以达到其最大弯曲角度137\textdegree,且当环境相对湿度降至30\%时,薄膜能够快速恢复至其初始状态,整个驱动过程在3 s内便可完成。另外,通过对GO层进行定向排列,可以制得弯曲方向可控的GO-CNT/PDMS双层复合薄膜基驱动器。最后通过一系列的仿生设计,该GO-CNT/PDMS被制备成智能手指、智能镊子、智能开关等,我们相信此驱动薄膜在未来的仿生智能器件以及柔性机器人领域将具有较大的应用前景。},

The copolymer formed micelles in mixtures of tetrahydrofuran and hexane. Treating cotton swatches by soaking them in micellar solutions, removing them, and annealing them at 120 \textdegree C after solvent evaporation yielded swatches with their fibers covered by the copolymer. Our X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and surface wetting property analyses indicated that the PDMS block topped the polymer coating. Photolyzing the cotton swatches under a mask crosslinked the anchoring PCEA layer around the fibers in the unmasked regions. While the crosslinked copolymer was not removed by dichloromethane extraction, the polymer in the non-irradiated regions was readily extracted, regenerating the cotton fibers. Since PDMS-coated regions were superhydrophobic and the regenerated cotton was hydrophilic, these treatments yielded hydrophilically patterned superhydrophobic cotton fabrics. While water-based solutions such as ink readily permeated the hydrophilic regions, they were blocked in the superhydrophobic regions. Thus, inverted ink or dye reservoirs held by these cotton swatches were used as stamps for ink or dye printing, reproducing the original lithographic mask pattern. The pattern has been printed onto fabrics, cardboard, paper, wood, and aluminum foil.},

  abstract = {We systematically investigate the factors during movement through experiment and innovative modeling, which combine pertinent forces.           ,                             The motion of liquid metal has potential applications ranging from micro-pumps and self-fueled motors to rapid cooling and drug delivery. In this study, we systematically investigate the effects of the radius of LMDs (liquid metal droplets), the concentration of electrolyte solution and the applied electric field on the movement behavior of LMDs experimentally. The research also explains the experimental phenomenon with an innovative modeling analysis, which combines pertinent forces (               i.e.               , the driving force induced by the gradient of surface tension, the viscous friction between the droplet and its surrounding electrolyte, and the friction between the droplet and the substrate). The model is highly consistent with the rule that LMDs with a larger radius need smaller actuation voltage, and we can predict the critical voltages of LMDs with               r               = 2\textendash 4 mm through               V               electrode               = 30.62/               r               2               - 0.998, which is obtained by fitting the parameters. We also obtain the model               V               = [-66.2               Vr               2               /(259.7\textendash 17.7) + 1.253]               r               2               , which can predict the average velocity\textendash voltage lines of LMDs with               r               = 3, 3.5 mm and               V               = 1\textendash 13 V. In addition, the velocity increases upon increasing the concentration of the electrolyte solution from 0.1 mol L               -1               to 0.3 mol L               -1               , and tends to be stable at more than 0.3 mol L               -1               owing to the saturation of the EDL (electrical double layer) charge density. Additionally, we discuss the phenomenon of elongation during movement that occurs upon increasing the size of the LMDs. If the size of the LMDs continues to increase, the reverse movement from the anode to the cathode can occur, and the phenomenon can also be explained by the model.},

  abstract = {Stretchable electroluminescent (EL) devices are a new form of mechanically deformable electronics that are gaining increasing interests and believed to be one of the essential technologies for next generation lighting and display applications. Apart from the simple bending capability in flexible EL devices, the stretchable EL devices are required to withstand larger mechanical deformations and accommodate stretching strain beyond 10\%. The excellent mechanical conformability in these devices enables their applications in rigorous mechanical conditions such as flexing, twisting, stretching, and folding.The stretchable EL devices can be conformably wrapped onto arbitrary curvilinear surface and respond seamlessly to the external or internal forces, leading to unprecedented applications that cannot be addressed with conventional technologies. For example, they are in demand for wide applications in biomedical-related devices or sensors and soft interactive display systems, including activating devices for photosensitive drug, imaging apparatus for internal tissues, electronic skins, interactive input and output devices, robotics, and volumetric displays. With increasingly stringent demand on the mechanical requirements, the fabrication of stretchable EL device is encountering many challenges that are difficult to resolve. In this review, recent progresses in the stretchable EL devices are covered with a focus on the approaches that are adopted to tackle materials and process challenges in stretchable EL devices and delineate the strategies in stretchable electronics. We first introduce the emission mechanisms that have been successfully demonstrated on stretchable EL devices. Limitations and advantages of the different mechanisms for stretchable EL devices are also discussed. Representative reports are reviewed based on different structural and material strategies. Unprecedented applications that have been enabled by the stretchable EL devices are reviewed. Finally, we summarize with our perspectives on the approaches for the stretchable EL devices and our proposals on the future development in these devices.},

It has 1) a detection model for target localization and 2) an appearance embedding model for data association. Having the two models separately executed might lead to efficiency problems, as the running time is simply a sum of the two steps without investigating potential structures that can be shared between them. Existing research efforts on real-time MOT usually focus on the association step, so they are essentially real-time association methods but not real-time MOT system. In this paper, we propose an MOT system that allows target detection and appearance embedding to be learned in a shared model. Specifically, we incorporate the appearance embedding model into a single-shot detector, such that the model can simultaneously output detections and the corresponding embeddings. We further propose a simple and fast association method that works in conjunction with the joint model. In both components the computation cost is significantly reduced compared with former MOT systems, resulting in a neat and fast baseline for future follow-ups on real-time MOT algorithm design. To our knowledge, this work reports the first (near) real-time MOT system, with a running speed of 22 to 40 FPS depending on the input resolution.

However, in many common hydrogels, there exists irreversible elongation upon prolonged stretching cycles and poor interfacial contact, which have significantly hindered their practical applications where long-term operation at large deformations is needed. Herein, multifunctional soft electronic devices with reversible stretchability and improved electrode/electrolyte interfaces are demonstrated by employing polyacrylamide-based double-network organohydrogel electrolytes soaked with a high content of tannic acid (TA) that affords multiple noncovalent interactions and redox activity. Performances of the TA-rich gels are evaluated for the first time in realizing shape-recoverable stretchable devices against repeated deformations to 500\% strain, with superior gel-electrode interfaces exhibiting both intimate adhesion and boosted electrochemical capacitance of {$>$}200 mF{$\cdot$}cm-2. A maximal 4-fold higher capacitance can be achieved by introducing TA and ethylene glycol (EG) into hydrogels. Moreover, a soft electronic system consisting of stretchable supercapacitors and gel-based microsensors was demonstrated, in which the electronic performance of these devices can be well preserved after {$>$}1000 repeated cycles at strains of up to 200\%, without obvious residual strain or electrode delamination. This could pave a route to the design of multifunctional gel networks tackling both the mechanical and interfacial issues in soft and biocompatible devices.},

The spray-coated all-NW device exhibited high transparency, good mechanical bending stability, high photoresponse, and short cutoff wavelength. The Schottky barrier between the Ag\textendash ZGO NWs together with the junction barrier between interconnecting ZGO NWs contributed to a high photoresponse and improved switching time in the devices.

We employ the combined effects of surface tension, elastic force and Coulomb force to manipulate the flexible thin film to encapsulate and release a tiny droplet in a controllable and reversible manner. An alternating current electric field is applied to actuate the droplet and film to vibrate, as if they are dancing to a melody. We measured the frequency of the droplet and the film vibration and found that it was twice the input signal; we also carried out frequency analysis experiments. The frequency-doubling phenomenon can be explained theoretically. Our findings may offer a practical method for drug encapsulation and for the actuation of microelectromechanical system devices.},

It is worth mentioning that the surface of these composite fibers is not a smooth silver layer, but a layer made of tightly stacked Ag nanoparticles, which contribute to a fast response time, ultralow detection limit, and bidirectional resistance change. Benefiting from the excellent performance, these fibers have been demonstrated to be used as a flexible sensor in wearable e-textiles.

Using opposite chiralities of twist and coiling produces supercoiled natural rubber fibers and coiled fishing line fibers that cool when stretched. A demonstrated twist-based device for cooling flowing water provides high cooling energy and device efficiency.

  abstract = {Wetting and electrowetting (EW) on corrugated substrates are studied experimentally and theoretically in this paper. On corrugated substrates, because of the anisotropy of surface morphology, the droplet shows an elliptical shape and the spreading velocities in different directions are different. Spreading of a droplet is usually controlled not only by the surface tensions but also by hemi-wicking. Our experimental results indicated that liquids along the grooves propagate much faster than those in the direction vertical to the grooves. However, spreading in both directions obeys the same scaling law of  {$\mathsl{l}\sim$} {$\mathsl{t}$} 4/5 l{$\sim$}t4/5 . EW on corrugated substrates reveals some differences with that on smooth surfaces. The change of contact angles with an applied voltage follows a linear relationship in two stages instead of the smooth curve on flat surfaces. There exists a critical voltage which divides the two stages. The transition of a droplet from the Cassie state to the Wenzel state on corrugated substrates was also discussed. The extended EW equation was derived with the free energy minimization approach, and the anisotropic factor was introduced. From the extended equation, it is found that EW is affected by the anisotropic factor significantly. For the smooth surfaces, the extended EW equation will degenerate to the classical Lippmann-Young equation. Our research may help us to understand the wetting and EW of droplets on corrugated substrates and assist in their design for practical applications.},

The as-grown Zn2GeO4 NWs exhibited n-type characteristic due to native defects and formed a p-n heterojunction with the p-GaN substrate. The unique energy level of Zn2GeO4 NWs promotes electron injection into GaN active region while suppressing hole injection into Zn2GeO4 NWs. The device exhibited an emission centered at 426 nm and a low turn-on voltage around 4 V. Zn2GeO4 NWs are first reported in this paper as promising electron transport and injection material for electroluminescent devices.},

  abstract = {The use of electrowetting-on-dielectric to enhance liquid metal extrusion printing is reported. Electrowetting facilitates the controlled deposition of gallium alloys on any substrate, specifically those relevant to radio-frequency (RF) electronics and other ``non-stick'' surfaces. To enhance adhesion on these surfaces, electric fields are applied between liquid metal and an underlying substrate electrode during extrusion. This process, termed as electrowetting-assisted selective printing (EWASP), allows digital control of the printing process by toggling the voltage, as well as analog control by tuning the amplitude of the applied voltage. EWASP improves the control of the printing process by increasing both the range and selectivity of trace widths, allowing printing on omni-phobic surfaces, vertically oriented features, and printing liquid metal directly into a prepolymer matrix. Gallium-based liquid metals such as eutectic gallium\textendash indium (EGaIn) form an oxide shell which structurally secures the printed metal's shape once voltage is removed. EWASP enables the pattern definition of stable-printed liquid metal features defined by an underlying electrode and the subsequent transfer to another substrate or encapsulation within elastomers. Pattern transfer is demonstrated by both serial extrusion over electrode features and by a parallel dip-coating process where the substrate is immersed in liquid metal and extracted with voltage applied, replicating the electrode features in liquid metal.},

  abstract = {A new CFD model for Liquid-solid Fluidized Bed Separator (LSFBS), namely the Eulerian-Eulerian-Lagrangian/ RNG k-{$\epsilon$} approach, was put forward and validated. According to the simulated separation results of two cases, the root-mean-square error (RMSE) between predicted partition numbers of all density fractions and corresponding experimental values were 2.47 and 2.83 respectively, demonstrating the CFD model was able to give accurate simulation results. The Rosin-Rammler model was used to describe the size distribution characteristics (SDC) of the feed, with the parameter Dx and n describing the fineness and particles size variation of the feed respectively. Single-factor tests and central composite design were then developed and simulated using the CFD model to investigate the influence of the two aspects of SDC on the separation performance of LSFBS based on density. The simulated separation results indicate that the finer the feed is, the greater the separation density ({$\delta$}50) and Ep value are; the smaller the particles size variation is, the smaller the {$\delta$}50 and Ep value are. According to the response surface analysis, the influence of feed fineness on {$\delta$}50 is larger than that of particles size variation while the influence of feed fineness on Ep is smaller than that of particles size variation; the interactive effect between these two factors has a noteworthy influence on Ep but insignificant influence on {$\delta$}50.},

In this paper, we integrate appearance information to improve the performance of SORT. Due to this extension we are able to track objects through longer periods of occlusions, effectively reducing the number of identity switches. In spirit of the original framework we place much of the computational complexity into an offline pre-training stage where we learn a deep association metric on a largescale person re-identification dataset. During online application, we establish measurement-to-track associations using nearest neighbor queries in visual appearance space. Experimental evaluation shows that our extensions reduce the number of identity switches by 45\%, achieving overall competitive performance at high frame rates.},

However, it is still quite challenging to construct artificial soft actuators with octopus-like synergistic shape/color change and directional locomotion behaviors, but such systems could enhance the functions of soft robotics dramatically. Herein, we proposed to utilize unique hydrophobic carbon dots (CDs) with rotatable surficial groups to construct the aggregation-induced emission (AIE) active glycol CDs polymer gel, which could be further employed to be interfacially bonded to an elastomer to produce anisotropic bilayer soft actuator. When putting the actuator on a water surface, glycol spontaneously diffused out from the gel layer to allow water intake, resulting in a color change from a blue dispersion fluorescence to red AIE and a shape deformation, as well as a large surface tension gradient that can promote its autonomous locomotion. Based on these findings, artificial soft swimming robots with octopus-like synergistic shape/color change and directional swimming motion were demonstrated. This study provides an elegant strategy to develop advanced multi-functional bio-inspired intelligent soft robotics.},

Here, a cost-effective strategy is proposed to fabricate a high-adhesion stretchable electrode. By modifying dopamine and functionalized silane on a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) substrate in sequence before the electroless deposition process, super-high adhesion up to 3.1 MPa is achieved between the PDMS substrate and silver layer, and the electrode exhibits extraordinary conductivity of 4.0 \texttimes{} 107 S/m. This process is also suitable for other common flexible substrates and metals. Moreover, inspired by the micro-/nanostructure on the surface of lotus leaf, a biomimetic elastomeric micropore film with a uniformly distributed micropore is fabricated by the one-step soft lithography replication process. The electrode exhibits a large tensile limit exceeding 70\% uniaxial tensile and superior electrical stability from 6.3 to 11.5 {$\Omega$} under 20\% uniaxial tensile for more than 10 000 cycles. This study seeks a promising method to manufacture stretchable electrodes with high adhesion, large tensile limit, and excellent electrical stability, showing great potential to detect various biological signals including joint movement, surface electromyography, and so forth.},

The established model is validated by the particle separation in micro-channel under SSAWs as the simulation results are in good agreement with experiments in publication. The consistency between the numerical simulation results and the experimental results in separation time and separation distance confirms the merits of model.

In this paper, we give a comprehensive survey of recent advances in visual object detection with deep learning. By reviewing a large body of recent related work in literature, we systematically analyze the existing object detection frameworks and organize the survey into three major parts: (i) detection components, (ii) learning strategies, and (iii) applications \& benchmarks. In the survey, we cover a variety of factors affecting the detection performance in detail, such as detector architectures, feature learning, proposal generation, sampling strategies, etc. Finally, we discuss several future directions to facilitate and spur future research for visual object detection with deep learning.},

  abstract = {为了研究尾流的特性在比较了几种研究方法后本文采用光散射的方法进行研究。尾流中存在大量的气泡，它的光学特性主要是由这些大量运动的气泡决定的。所以本文从对单个气泡光散射性质的研究出发，将Mie散射理论应用于气泡的光散射。首先从Mie散射理论出发在计算机上模拟了单个气泡的光学散射模型，得出了单个气泡的光散射性质与气泡直径和相对折射率有着密切关系。在单个气泡散射模型的基础上进一步讨论了气泡群散射的性质，在满足不相关散射的条件下气泡群的散射满足单个气泡散射的线性叠加。在假定的气泡群的散射数学模型条件下，可以在通过实验测量出尾流的散射光强度然后利用数学上的反演算法来推算出气泡群的运动速度、直径和密度分布等。它们表征尾流的特性是探测尾流的主要参数。本文在理论上对尾流散射光性质论证后，在实验室的条件下模拟尾流。实验中首次采用富里叶光学系统和CMOS图像传感器采集尾流的散射光信号。实验中激光器发出的波长为532nm蓝绿激光通过扩束准直透镜和小孔全反射镜入射到水中气泡群中，散射光经过全反射镜反射转向进入富里叶光路中，CMOS采集的散射光信号经过图像采集卡记录在计算机硬盘上。数据处理时采用动态和静态两种散射光分析方法。采集到的散射光信号由于大量运动气泡的存在变化非常复杂，在动态光散射分析时采用快速富里叶变换将时间域的信号转换到频域内，得到了信号的频谱强度图。通过频谱分析得出了信号的特征频率，而这些特征频率与气泡的运动速度有着直接关系，所以可以通过分析动态散射光信号得出气泡群主要几种运动速度。静态光散射分析方法就是分析采集信号中一帧图像，对图像采用滤波和线性分环的方法得出气泡群不同角度散射光强，从而采用合适的反演算法得出气泡群的直径和密度分布。通过实验和理论两个方面的研究，得出气泡的运动速度在气泡直径小于1mm时与气泡直径呈线性增长关系，尾流后向散射光在180度时达到最大。通过尾流的后向散射光探测尾流是可行的。},

For this work, a simple and rapid method was introduced to fabricate the Galinstan electrodes with precise patterns and to exfoliate their surface oxide layers. Thin conductive films possessing flexibility and stretchability can be easily prepared on flexible substrates with large areas through compression of a dried suspension of Galinstan microdroplets. Furthermore, a laser marking machine was employed to facilitate patterning of the Galinstan films at a high resolution of 20 {$\mu$}m. The patterned Galinstan films were used as flexible and stretchable electrodes. The electrical conductivity of these electrodes was measured to be \textasciitilde 1.3 \texttimes{} 106 S m-1, which were still electrically conductive even if the stretching ratio increased up to 130\% below 0 \textdegree C. In addition, the surface oxide (i.e., Ga2O3) layers possessing photo-responsive properties were spontaneously formed on the Galinstan surfaces under ambient conditions, which could be solely exfoliated using elastomeric stamps. By combining Galinstan and its surface oxide layers, solar-blind photodetectors were successfully fabricated on flexible substrates, exhibiting a distinct increase of up to 14.7\% in output current under deep ultraviolet irradiation (254 nm wavelength) with an extremely low light intensity of 0.1 mW cm-2, whereas no significant change was observed under visible light irradiation.},

  abstract = {Over the past decades, interest in shape memory polymers (SMPs) has persisted, and immense efforts have been dedicated to developing SMPs and their multifunctional composites. As a class of stimuli-responsive polymers, SMPs can return to their initial shape from a programmed temporary shape under external stimuli, such as light, heat, magnetism, and electricity. The introduction of functional materials and nanostructures results in shape memory polymer composites (SMPCs) with large recoverable deformation, enhanced mechanical properties, and controllable remote actuation. Because of these unique features, SMPCs have a broad application prospect in many fields covering aerospace engineering, biomedical devices, flexible electronics, soft robotics, shape memory arrays, and 4D printing. Herein, a comprehensive analysis of the shape recovery mechanisms, multifunctionality, applications, and recent advances in SMPs and SMPCs is presented. Specifically, the combination of functional, reversible, multiple, and controllable shape recovery processes is discussed. Further, established products from such materials are highlighted. Finally, potential directions for the future advancement of SMPs are proposed.},

  abstract = {Soft actuators are now required to be smarter to perceive the outside world besides mechanical deformation, which has broader applications in soft robotics, wearable devices and biomedical electronics. However, most of the sensory actuators in previous research were complicated because of the separation of sensing and actuating units. Here, a shape-memory soft actuator integrated with reversible electric/moisture actuating and strain sensing was prepared with a compact sandwich structure. Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) were used to form a middle composite layer, connecting a hygroscopically deformable polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) layer with a highperformance flexible shape memory polymer (FSMP) layer. With the electrothermal AgNP layer, the PVAAgNPs-FSMP (PAF) composite shows quick recovery (within 10 s) under ultralow voltage (2 V), high strainsensing sensitivity (1.56 Gauge Factor) and fast response to deformation (110 m s). What is more, the compact construction endows the PAF composite with electrical stability in 1000 bending cycles. Due to the novel combination of PVA, FSMP and AgNPs, the low-power PAF actuator can efficiently load and unload target objects without additional cooling process, and distinguish the presence and weights of them in real time. The results suggest that the soft PAF actuator has great potential applications in soft robotics and biomimetic devices, especially in automated packaging production lines of food, medicine, logistics sorting and other industries.},

We designed an adhesive, gas-tight, and self-healing supramolecular polysiloxane-dimethylglyoxime\textendash based polyurethane (PDPU) porous elastomer based on segmented oxime-carbamate-urea. It is an intrinsically triboelectric negative material with trapped air within closed voids, exhibiting ultrahigh static surface potential and excellent compressibility. This porous PDPU generates electricity from interactions between the trapped air and the elastomeric matrix under periodical compression. The positively charged trapped air (or other gas) dominates the tribo-electrification with PDPU, inducing electron transfer from gas to the solid polymer for electricity generation. The self-healable elastomer renders gas-solid interacted triboelectric nanogenerator, GS-TENG, with high stretchability (\textasciitilde 1200\%). The inherently adhesive surface enables adherance to other substrates, allowing mechanical energy harvesting from deformations such as bending, twisting, and stretching. GS-TENG promises a freestanding wearable functional tactile skin for self-powered sensing of touch pressure, human motions, and Parkinsonian gait.},

  abstract = {With the rapid development of visual inspection technology, computer technology, and image processing technology, machine vision technology has become more and more mature, and the role of quality inspection and control in the steel industry is becoming more and more obvious and important. Defects on the surface of the strip are a key factor affecting the quality inspection process. Its inspection plays an extremely important role in improving the final quality. For a long time, traditional manual inspection methods cannot meet actual production needs, so in-depth research on steel surface defect inspection systems has become the consensus of today's steel companies. The accuracy and low performance of traditional detection methods can no longer meet the needs of people and society. The surface defect detection method based on machine vision has the characteristics of high accuracy, fast processing speed, and intelligent processing, which is the main trend of surface defect detection. We select a steel plate; take the invariant moment features of the cracks, holes, scratches, oil stains, and other images on it; extract the data results; and analyze them. Then, we read the texture features of these defect images again, extract the data results, and analyze them. The experimental results prove that after the mean value filter and Gaussian filter process the image, the mean variance value MSE is relatively large (                                                   46.276                   {$>$}                   31.2271                                               ), and as the concentration of salt and pepper noise increases, the rate of increase of MSE increases obviously, and as the peak signal-to-noise ratio and the mean variance value MSE increase continuously (                                                   32.2271                   {$<$}                   33.3695                                               ), the image distortion is more serious.

  abstract = {基于介电湿润效应的数字微流控技术是近年来出现的一种能够在平面上操控体积为微升、纳升级别液滴的新技术，该技术可实现液滴的分配、液滴的分离与合并、液滴的输运四项基本操控，具有试剂消耗量少、试剂分析耗时短、设备体积小等特点，因此在生物、化学、光学透镜等领域得到了非常广泛的应用。本文针对目前微量液滴操作的迫切需求，从介电湿润驱动机理分析入手，开展微量液滴驱动理论研究，通过建立模型与数值仿真分析液滴受力、分析实现低电压驱动微流控芯片的实现方法，最后通过实验分别验证了低电压驱动芯片降低驱动电压的效果及基于液滴位置检测系统保证液滴连续运动的效果。     首先，介绍电毛细管现象、电湿润现象和介电湿润的原理；然后研究固液接触面表面束缚电荷作用机理。利用仿真软件COMSOLMultiphysics4.3对``介电湿润芯片\textemdash 液滴''系统中的电场，压力场和流场进行了数值仿真，数值仿真结果表明电场形成后在固液接触面上的正负离子、分子相互吸引产生静电力，使液滴表面张力发生改变，液滴左右两侧不对称的张力改变使液滴内部产生流体静力学压力，液滴在流体静力学压力的作用下产生运动。运用``三自由体表示''法描述了液滴从静止到实现运动的过程。     其次，根据能量最小化原理针对液滴在一个运动周期中不同阶段的受力进行了推导，通过数值仿真得到了一个运动周期中不同阶段的受力情况，仿真结果表明驱动电极在垂直于液滴运动方向上的长度越大液滴所受到的介电驱动力也就越大，该仿真结果有助于对介电湿润芯片进行优化。然后采用不同参数对液滴的受力进行仿真，并行了对比分析，发现提高驱动电压能获得较大的介电驱动力。并根据液滴所受驱动力与阻力建立了液滴的动能方程，数值仿真了液滴所受各个阻力，得到液滴所受介电驱动力相同情况下可以通过降低三相接触线摩擦力和极板剪切力的方法对介电湿润芯片进行优化设计。     然后，以降低介电湿润芯片驱动电压为目的，对芯片进行了优化设计，设计了悬空零电极结构的介电湿润芯片，数值仿真结果表明悬空零电极结构能降低液滴运动时受到的三相接触线摩擦力和极板剪切力。对比传统的方形和叉齿形驱动电极，设计了半月形驱动电极，数值仿真结果表明三种驱动电极结构（四种布局）中半月形的驱动电极上液滴的受力达到最大值时所需时间最短，而且液滴在被成功驱动前，同一驱动电压下的液滴发生局部运动的部分较大，因此，半月形驱动电极的介电湿润芯片不但能以较低的驱动电压驱动液滴，而且同等大小的驱动电压下液滴的运动速度最大。然后根据液滴分离的原理分析了不同电极形状及布局对液滴分离的影响，得到相对布局的半月形驱动电极有利于液滴的分离。     最后，悬空零电极结构的介电湿润芯片实验结果表明悬空零电极的结构设计能提高液滴运动速度，能相对降低芯片驱动电压。对比传统的方形和叉齿形驱动电极实验结果表明本文设计的半月形驱动电极具有降低芯片驱动电压的效果，同时液滴运动的连续性得到了提高。相对于方形和叉齿形驱动电极，实验结果表明相对布局的半月形驱动电极分离液滴的效率最高，液滴分离时的驱动电压最低。根据检测``介电湿润芯片\textemdash 液滴''系统等效电容的办法对液滴的位置进行实时检测，实验结果表明当液滴运动发生中断时能够对液滴的位置进行实时反馈，保证了液滴的连续运动。     本课题涉及多学科交叉研究与应用，文中所使用的理论、方法及得到的结论对进一步深入研究和设计基于介电湿润效应的数字微流控芯片具有一定的启发和指导意义。},

In this paper, we established the kinematics and dynamics models and proposed a dynamics control strategy. The multilevel mapping between the motors, cables, joints, and end-effector was first analyzed. The corresponding kinematics equations were derived and solved by combining analytical and numerical methods. Especially, the cable coupling relationship was established and a decoupling method was addressed to compensate the coupled motion between cables. Furthermore, we derived the dynamics equations including the cable forces and the joint variables. Considering practical control requirements, the cables' forces were distributed by simplifying the dynamics equations and obtaining the minimal solutions. Then, we presented a dynamics control strategy, which uses the forward and inverse kinematics of multilevel mapping for motion resolution and compensation, and computes the feedforward torques for the motors using recursive dynamics and ``cable force\textendash motor torque'' relationship. Finally, a prototype and a truss inspection experiment system were developed to verify the corresponding models and methods. Experiment results show that the derived kinematic and the dynamic equations, and the proposed dynamic control strategy are effective.},

  abstract = {随着纳米科学技术的发展,科学工作者们已经成功制备出具有独特电、磁、光、热、生物、化学等性能的功能性纳米颗粒。这些功能性纳米颗粒对于生物、医学、电子、化学、材料等许多学科领域的发展具有重大意义,其中荧光量子点和磁性纳米材料因其优良的发光性能和磁学性能,在生物医学领域具有广泛应用。然而,随着科学技术的进一步发展,单一功能的材料已经不再满足人们对先进材料的需求,因此,如果将磁性和荧光相结合,集分离和标记功能于一体,通过一定的物理化学工艺制备出多功能磁性荧光纳米复合材料,使其可以作为荧光探针的同时,还具有良好的磁靶向性。基于此,本课题采用具有核磁共振造影剂作用的超顺磁性Fe3O4@SiO2为磁核提供磁性,以颜色可调、高发光效率的核壳结构的ZnSe@ZnS量子点提供荧光,通过微乳液法制备同时包埋磁性纳米粒子和荧光量子点的Si02微粒,实现磁性荧光双功能复合。这种复合纳米材料不仅拓展了其生物医学应用潜力,还能有效克服磁性四氧化三铁纳米粒子易被氧化、量子点对周围环境的敏感性及生物毒性等问题,使两种纳米粒子的应用范围进一步扩大。此外,为了完善Fe3O4@SiO2磁性纳米粒子的性能,采用化学还原法在其表面沉积一层银单质,旨在制备出具有核壳结构的MNPs/Ag磁性粒子。将贵金属纳米材料覆盖到磁性纳米材料表面,可以大幅改良原磁性纳米颗粒的稳定性,同时其本身的独特性质也能结合到复合材料中,这可以一定程度上拓展纳米材料的实用性。银纳米颗粒在可见光区和近红外光区的等离子体共振特性使得银纳米颗粒具有较高的光催化性能、杀菌作用、表面增强光谱、光学性能等,同时相对于金属金、钮、铀而言,金属银的价格较低,因此磁性纳米粒子与贵金属Ag的复合具有研究价值。本论文采用微乳液法制备磁性荧光双功能复合颗粒,以环己烷为连续相,TriotnX-100为表面活性剂,正己醇为助活性剂,体积比为4：1：1时,可得到适于反应的微乳液,通过紫外吸收光谱和荧光光谱分析得到最佳制备工艺参数为：当量子点与磁性粒子的摩尔比为5：1,TEOS和氨水的体积分数分别2.2\%和3.2\%,反应时间为24h时,所制备磁性荧光双功能复合颗粒的性能最好。制备的磁性荧光复合颗粒基本呈球形,粒径大小在70nm左右,稳定性良好,其抗光漂白性能相比于量子点有所增强,可放置很长一段时间,并且表现出良好的超顺磁性。本论文采用微乳液法制备的Fe3O4@SiO2磁性粒子颗粒基本成球形,分散性良好,粒径大小在40nm左右。Fe3O4@SiO2磁性粒子表现出良好的超顺磁性,但比纯Fe304磁性粒子的性能有所降低。本论文采用化学还原法在Fe3O4@SiO2磁性粒子表面沉积一层薄的Ag壳层,粒径大小改变不大,颗粒仍呈球形,分散性良好。MNPs/Ag磁性粒子表现出良好的超顺磁性,同时由于Ag壳层比较薄,其磁性能接近于Fe3O4@SiO2磁性粒子,并且Fe3O4@SiO2与AgNO3的摩尔比为1：0.4时制备的MNPs/Ag中Ag的重量百分比较大为6.39。},

  abstract = {Electrowetting has been used to actuate and control the motion of droplets on solid surfaces. An analysis based on the theories of thermodynamics and thermal activation processes is presented for the electrowetting of a conducting droplet on a dielectric layer. The concept of release rate of electric energy is proposed. The release rate of electric energy is proportional to the square of the applied electric voltage and the derivative of electric capacitance with respect to the surface area of the corresponding electric system. The velocity of a contact line under the action of an electric voltage is a hyperbolic sine function of the release rate of electric energy. Using the release rate of electric energy and introducing line tension in the analysis, the contact angle of a droplet at a stationary state under the action of a constant electric voltage is found to be a linear function of the release rate of electric energy and the line tension. The line tension introduces the droplet-size effect on the contact angle. A critical contact angle as a function of the applied electric voltage, the thickness of the dielectric layer, and the radius of the contact area is obtained. There exist stable and unstable zones, depending on the relative value of the contact angle and the critical contact angle. There exists an upper bound of electric voltage with the corresponding contact angle of 65.89\textdegree{} between 60 and 70\textdegree{} of the saturated contact angle reported for electrowetting of conducting droplets. This result suggests that the saturation of contact angle likely is related to the condition determining the field-induced stability of the contact line.},

It has attracted much attention during the past several decades, and many excellent methods have been proposed. In this paper, we make a comprehensive introduction to representative edge and object contour detection methods in the past two decades. Based on the development of these methods, we mainly classify them into two categories: traditional methods and learning-based methods. We further divide traditional methods into local pattern methods, edge grouping methods, active contour models, and bio-inspired methods. Further, we divide learning-based methods into classical learning-based methods and deep learning-based methods. At the same time, we introduce the most popular benchmarks and evaluation measures and quantitatively compare the performances of these promising methods. Moreover, we discuss current challenges in edge and object contour detection and suggest some future trends to bridge gaps with human vision. We believe that this overview will benefit newcomers and promote the development of edge and object contour detection.},

Here, a bilayer actuator composed of spongy graphene with internal gasbag microstructures and the commercial polyimide adhesive tape is fabricated by a simple and fast method. This actuator produces large deformation, high output force, and dual-stimuli response, owing to the deformation of graphene micro-gasbags coupled with the thermal expansion of polyimide, and the electrothermal and photothermal properties of graphene. Experiments show that upon low voltage (16 V) stimulation the fabricated actuator with a length of 30 mm could generate a bending curvature of 0.55 cm-1 in 5 s, and can simultaneously produce high output force and lift an object 20 times heavier than its own weight. Moreover, a curvature of 0.45 cm-1 can be achieved for the actuator upon light irradiation for 10 s. Based on this bilayer actuator, diversely biomimetic motions including kicking a ball, grabbing a vegetable leaf, human hand movement, and creeping motion are realized, revealing its potential application in soft robotics, artificial muscles, wearable electronics, and biomedical devices. Besides the mechanical deformation output, a photo-to-electric generator is also assembled by associating this actuator with commonly triboelectric materials, further enriching the application range of soft actuators.},

The smart face mask relies on the compact, battery-free radio frequency (RF) harmonic transponder, which is attached to the inner layer of the mask for detecting its separation from the face. Specifically, the RF transponder composed of miniature antennas and passive frequency multiplier is made of spray-printed silver nanowires (AgNWs) coated with a poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) passivation layer and the recently discovered multiscale porous polystyrene-block-poly(ethylene-ran-butylene)-block-polystyrene (SEBS) substrate. Unlike conventional on-chip or on-board wireless sensors, the SEBS-AgNWs/PEDOT:PSS-based RF transponder is lightweight, stretchable, breathable, and comfortable. In addition, this wireless device has excellent resilience and robustness in long-term and repeated usages (i.e., repeated placement and removal of the soft transponder on the mask). We foresee that this wireless smart face mask, providing simultaneous cough and mask-wearing monitoring, may mitigate virus-transmissive events by tracking the potential contagious person and identifying mask-wearing conditions. Moreover, the ability to wirelessly assess cough frequencies may improve diagnosis accuracy for dealing with several diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.},

When electronic devices are worn, the mechanical flexibility and/or stretchability of thin-film devices helps to minimize the stress and discomfort associated with wear because of their conformability and softness. For industrial applications, it is important to fabricate wearable devices using processing methods that maximize throughput and minimize cost. We demonstrate ultraflexible and conformable three-color, highly efficient polymer light-emitting diodes (PLEDs) and organic photodetectors (OPDs) to realize optoelectronic skins (oe-skins) that introduce multiple electronic functionalities such as sensing and displays on the surface of human skin. The total thickness of the devices, including the substrate and encapsulation layer, is only 3 {$\mu$}m, which is one order of magnitude thinner than the epidermal layer of human skin. By integrating green and red PLEDs with OPDs, we fabricate an ultraflexible reflective pulse oximeter. The device unobtrusively measures the oxygen concentration of blood when laminated on a finger. On-skin seven-segment digital displays and color indicators can visualize data directly on the body.},

A wetting transition in the interior corner of a single-file water-molecule precursor chain (PC), which eliminated the stress singularity and advanced much faster than the precursor film, was controlled by the interior angle. Owing to the confinement in the interior corner, the potential surface is lower and smoother. The one-dimensional hydrogen-bond chain transferred the disjoining pressure to drive the PC to slip-like ice. As an example, a stable and long metallic monatomic chain was formed using the unique transport properties of the PC for the first time. Our results may help in understanding the topology-dominated dynamic wetting in a hydrophilic interior corner, expand `Taylor conjecture' to nanoscale and develop new applications at nanoscale.},

Tay et al. have proposed a parametrization of the plant dynamics by switching the role of the controlled plant and the controller, and introduced a free parameter R /spl epsiv/ RH/sub /spl infin//. In this paper, we propose a new joint design strategy based on the identification of R and the design of Q. Since the identified plant parameter R is always stable, the proposed joint design strategy can be applied to a wider class than (including unstable plants) the conventional joint design method. Finally, the usefulness of the proposed method is verified by some simulations.},

They can sense strain via changes in resistance resulting from separation of the fillers during elongation. Thus, most elastic composites exhibit a negative piezoconductive effect, i.e. the conductivity decreases under tensile strain. This property is undesirable for stretchable conductors since such composites may become less conductive during deformation. Here, we report a liquid metal-filled magnetorheological elastomer comprising a hybrid of fillers of liquid metal microdroplets and metallic magnetic microparticles. The composite's resistivity reaches a maximum value in the relaxed state and drops drastically under any deformation, indicating that the composite exhibits an unconventional positive piezoconductive effect. We further investigate the magnetic field-responsive thermal properties of the composite and demonstrate several proof-of-concept applications. This composite has prospective applications in sensors, stretchable conductors, and responsive thermal interfaces.},

  abstract = {Dielectric elastomer generator (DEG), consisting of highly deformable dielectric elastomer (DE) film sandwiched between two compliant electrodes, can convert mechanical energy into electrical energy. To achieve high energy harvesting performance and practical durability, electrode material with high stability of electrical conductivity (EC) and self-healing/recycling capability is required. In this study, we designed and prepared conductive rubber electrode with high EC, high stability of EC at high strain and high durability during cyclic stretching, selfhealing and recycling ability for DEG by synthesizing a hydrogen bond crosslinked supramolecular network of silicone rubber (SiR-SN) followed by introducing a commercially available, highly conductive carbon black (CB) and carbon grease (CG) into SiR-SN matrix. The addition of CG composed of silicone oligomer (SO) and CB can induce the partial phase separation of polar SiR-SN and the formation of segregated conductive network, leading to the significantly enhanced EC and stability of EC at high strain. The presence of SO chains also increases the chain mobility, leading to the high durability, self-healing ability and recyclability of the electrode. Compared with CG electrode commonly used in laboratory, the energy loss at 3 kV and 400\% strain of DEG using the 5 phr CB/60 phr CG/SiR-SN electrode is reduced by 83.5\%, and the harvested energy density increases by 73.1\%, which reaches 23 mJ/cm3, much higher than that reported in previous studies. Meanwhile, this electrode shows high self-healing efficiency of conductivity (92\% at 60 {$\smwhtcircle$}C for 4 h), and can be recycled for 5 times without negative effect on performance.},

  abstract = {Multi-object tracking (MOT) is an important problem in computer vision which has a wide range of applications. Formulating MOT as multi-task learning of object detection and re-ID in a single network is appealing since it allows joint optimization of the two tasks and enjoys high computation efficiency. However, we find that the two tasks tend to compete with each other which need to be carefully addressed. In particular, previous works usually treat re-ID as a secondary task whose accuracy is heavily affected by the primary detection task. As a result, the network is biased to the primary detection task which is not fair to the re-ID task. To solve the problem, we present a simple yet effective approach termed as FairMOT based on the anchorfree object detection architecture CenterNet. Note that it is not a naive combination of CenterNet and re-ID. Instead, we present a bunch of detailed designs which are critical to achieve good tracking results by thorough empirical studies. The resulting approach achieves high accuracy for both detection and tracking. The approach outperforms the state-ofthe-art methods by a large margin on several public datasets.},

  abstract = {Siamese tracking has achieved groundbreaking performance in recent years, where the essence is the efficient matching operator cross-correlation and its variants. Besides the remarkable success, it is important to note that the heuristic matching network design relies heavily on expert experience. Moreover, we experimentally find that one sole matching operator is difficult to guarantee stable tracking in all challenging environments. Thus, in this work, we introduce six novel matching operators from the perspective of feature fusion instead of explicit similarity learning, namely Concatenation, Pointwise-Addition, PairwiseRelation, FiLM, Simple-Transformer and TransductiveGuidance, to explore more feasibility on matching operator selection. The analyses reveal these operators' selective adaptability on different environment degradation types, which inspires us to combine them to explore complementary features. To this end, we propose binary channel manipulation (BCM) to search for the optimal combination of these operators. BCM determines to retrain or discard one operator by learning its contribution to other tracking steps. By inserting the learned matching networks to a strong baseline tracker Ocean [47], our model achieves favorable gains by 67.2 \textrightarrow{} 71.4, 52.6 \textrightarrow{} 58.3, 70.3 \textrightarrow{} 76.0 success on OTB100, LaSOT, and TrackingNet, respectively. Notably, Our tracker, dubbed AutoMatch, uses less than half of training data/time than the baseline tracker, and runs at 50 FPS using PyTorch.

This paper proposes a device that uses three modes of ultrasonic standing waves to continuously separate particles with positive acoustic contrast factor in microfluidics. Three modes of acoustic standing waves are used simultaneously in different parts of the microchannel. According to the different acoustic radiation force received by the particles, the particles are finally separated to the pressure node lines on both sides and the center of the microchannel. In this separation method, initial hydrodynamic focusing and satisfying various equilibrium constraints during the separation process are the key. Through nu\- merical simulation, the resonance frequency of the interdigital transducer, the distribution of sound pressure in the liquid, and the relationship between the interdigital electrode voltage and the output sound pressure are obtained. Finally, the entire separation process in the microchannel was simulated, and the separation of the two particles was successfully achieved. This work has laid a certain theoretical foundation for the rapid diagnosis of diseases in practical applications.},

Under a gradually increased electric field, a droplet is pushed by the electromechanical force to spread, and goes through the Cassie state, the Cassie-to-Wenzel wetting transition and the Wenzel state, which can be characterized by the electrowetting number at the microscale {$\eta$}m. The expansion of the liquid is direction-dependent and influenced by the surface topology. A positive voltage is induced in the bulk droplet, while a negative one is induced in the liquid confined among the pillars, which makes the liquid hard to spread and further polarize. Based on the molecular kinetic theory and the wetting states, theoretical models have been proposed to comprehend the physical mechanisms in the statics and dynamics of electrowetting, and are validated by our simulations. Our findings may help to understand the electrowetting on microtextured surfaces and assist the future design of engineered surfaces in practical applications.},

Our network takes a short sequence of frames as input and produces global trajectories for all objects. The core component is a global tracking transformer that operates on objects from all frames in the sequence. The transformer encodes object features from all frames, and uses trajectory queries to group them into trajectories. The trajectory queries are object features from a single frame and naturally produce unique trajectories. Our global tracking transformer does not require intermediate pairwise grouping or combinatorial association, and can be jointly trained with an object detector. It achieves competitive performance on the popular MOT17 benchmark, with 75.3 MOTA and 59.1 HOTA. More importantly, our framework seamlessly integrates into stateof-the-art large-vocabulary detectors to track any objects. Experiments on the challenging TAO dataset show that our framework consistently improves upon baselines that are based on pairwise association, outperforming published works by a significant 7.7 tracking mAP.

  abstract = {ConspectusNature's evolution over billions of years has led to the development of different kinds of twisted structures in a variety of biological species. Twisted fibers from nanoscale- to micrometer-scale diameter have been prepared by mimicking natural twisted structures. Mechanically inserting twist in a yarn is an efficient and important method, which generates internal stress, changes the macromolecular orientation, and increases compactness. Recently, twist insertion has been found to produce interesting fiber properties, including chemical, mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties. This Account summarizes recent progress in how twist insertion affects the chemical and physical properties of fibers and describes their applications in artificial spider silk, artificial muscles, refrigeration, and electricity generation.Twist and associated chirality widely arise in nature from molecules to nano- and microscale materials to macroscopic objects such as DNA, RNA, peptides, and chromosomes. Such twisted architectures play an important role in improving the mechanical properties and enabling biological functions. Inspired by the beauty and interesting properties of twisted structures, a wide range of artificial chiral materials with twisted or coiled structures have been prepared, from organic and inorganic nanorods, nanotubes, and nanobelts to macroscopic architectures and buildings.An efficient way to prepare twisted materials is by inserting twist in fibers or yarns, which is an ancient technique used to make yarns or ropes (Wang, R., et al. Science 2019, 366, 216\textendash 221. Mu, J., et al. Science 2019, 365, 150\textendash 155). During the twisting process, torque is generated in fibers or yarns, the structure of the polymer chains becomes helically oriented, and the fibers in a yarn become more compact. Therefore, the twisting of fibers and yarns can produce novel chemical, mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties (Dou, Y., et al. Nat. Commun. 2019, 10, 1\textendash 10. Kim, S. H., et al. Science 2017, 357, 773\textendash 778). This Account focuses on the novel properties generated by twist insertion. The mechanical stress and strain can be optimized in a yarn by twist insertion, and different types of fibers exhibit rather different mechanisms.In the first section, we will focus on recent progress in improving the mechanical properties of twisted fibers, including carbon nanotube yarns, single-filament fibers, and hydrogel fibers. Torque was generated by twist insertion in a fiber or a yarn, and the balance of internal torsional stress can be changed by causing a change in yarn volume. This will result in twist release and torsional and tensile actuations of the yarn, which will be described in the second section. Twisting a yarn generally makes it more compact, which will result in a mechanically induced change in capacitance, supercapacitance, and other useful electrochemical properties when a conducting yarn is in an electrolyte. Such processes were used to develop novel devices for twist-based electricity generation, called twistrons, which will be discussed in the third section. Twist insertion or release also changes the polymer chain orientation or crystal structure, resulting in changes in entropy. This is called the twistocaloric effect, which was used to develop a new cooling method, and will be discussed in the last section.},

Nowadays, tracking is dominated by pipelines that perform object detection followed by temporal association, also known as tracking-by-detection. We present a simultaneous detection and tracking algorithm that is simpler, faster, and more accurate than the state of the art. Our tracker, CenterTrack, applies a detection model to a pair of images and detections from the prior frame. Given this minimal input, CenterTrack localizes objects and predicts their associations with the previous frame. That's it. CenterTrack is simple, online (no peeking into the future), and real-time. It achieves 67.8\% MOTA on the MOT17 challenge at 22 FPS and 89.4\% MOTA on the KITTI tracking benchmark at 15 FPS, setting a new state of the art on both datasets. CenterTrack is easily extended to monocular 3D tracking by regressing additional 3D attributes. Using monocular video input, it achieves 28.3\% AMOTA@0.2 on the newly released nuScenes 3D tracking benchmark, substantially outperforming the monocular baseline on this benchmark while running at 28 FPS.},

However, it's challenging to realize these functions in hydrogels due to the poor mechanical properties and lack of tunable fluorescence. A tough hydrogel with good shape-memory ability and phototunable fluorescence is reported here, which affords reprogrammable shape designing and information encoding for dual-encryption. This hydrogel is prepared by incorporating donor\textendash acceptor chromophore units into a poly(1-vinylimidazole-co-methacrylic acid) network, in which the dense intra- and interchain hydrogen bonds lead to desirable features including high stiffness, high toughness, and temperature-mediated shape-memory property. Additionally, the hydrogel shows photomediated tunable fluorescence through a unimer-to-dimer transformation of the chromophores. By combining photolithography and origami/kirigami designs, hydrogel sheets encoded with fluorescent patterns can deform into specific 3D configurations. The geometrically encrypted fluorescent information in the architected hydrogels is readable only after sequential shape recovery and UV light irradiation. As demonstrated by proof-of-concept experiments, both the fluorescent pattern and the 3D configuration are reprogrammable, facilitating repeated information protection and display.

  abstract = {Purpose The goal of this study was to introduce a new method to selectively detect iron oxide contrast agents using an acoustic wave to perturb the spin-locked water signal in the vicinity of the magnetic particles. The acoustic drive can be modulated externally to turn the effect on and off, allowing sensitive and quantitative statistical comparison and removal of confounding image background variations. Methods We demonstrated the effect in spin-locking experiments using piezoelectric actuators to generate vibrational displacements of iron oxide samples. We observed a resonant behavior of the signal changes with respect to the acoustic frequency where iron oxide is present. We characterized the effect as a function of actuator displacement and contrast agent concentration. Results The resonant effect allowed us to generate block-design ``modulation response maps'' indicating the contrast agent's location, as well as positive contrast images with suppressed background signal. We found that the acoustically induced rotary saturation (AIRS) effect stayed approximately constant across acoustic frequency and behaved monotonically over actuator displacement and contrast agent concentration. Conclusion AIRS is a promising method capable of using acoustic vibrations to modulate the contrast from iron oxide nanoparticles and thus perform selective detection of the contrast agents, potentially enabling more accurate visualization of contrast agents in clinical and research settings.

  abstract = {The development of wearable/stretchable electronics could largely benefit from advanced stretchable antennas with excellent on-body performance upon mechanical deformations. Despite recent developments of stretchable antennas based on intrinsically stretchable conductors, they are often affected by lossy human tissues and exhibit resonant frequency shifts upon stretching, preventing their applications in on-body wireless communication and powering. This work reports a three-dimensional (3D) stretchable wideband dipole antenna from mechanical assembly to simultaneously reduce the frequency detuning and enhance on-body performance. The large bandwidth is achieved by coupling two resonances from two pairs of radiation arms, which is well-maintained even when the antenna is directly placed on human bodies or stretched over 25\%. Such an excellent on-body performance allows the antenna to robustly transmit the wireless data and energy. The design of the 3D stretchable wideband dipole antenna with significantly enhanced on-body wireless communication performance was validated by an experimental demonstration that features a small difference in the wirelessly received power between the on-body and off-body use. The combination of the mechanically assembled 3D geometries and the coupled mechanicalelectromagnetic properties can open up new opportunities in deformable 3D antennas and other microwave devices with excellent on-body performance and tunable properties.},

  abstract = {Object detection on drone-captured scenarios is a recent popular task. As drones always navigate in different altitudes, the object scale varies violently, which burdens the optimization of networks. Moreover, high-speed and low-altitude flight bring in the motion blur on the densely packed objects, which leads to great challenge of object distinction. To solve the two issues mentioned above, we propose TPH-YOLOv5. Based on YOLOv5, we add one more prediction head to detect different-scale objects. Then we replace the original prediction heads with Transformer Prediction Heads (TPH) to explore the prediction potential with self-attention mechanism. We also integrate convolutional block attention model (CBAM) to find attention region on scenarios with dense objects. To achieve more improvement of our proposed TPH-YOLOv5, we provide bags of useful strategies such as data augmentation, multiscale testing, multi-model integration and utilizing extra classifier. Extensive experiments on dataset VisDrone2021 show that TPH-YOLOv5 have good performance with impressive interpretability on drone-captured scenarios. On DET-test-challenge dataset, the AP result of TPH-YOLOv5 are 39.18\%, which is better than previous SOTA method (DPNetV3) by 1.81\%. On VisDrone Challenge 2021, TPHYOLOv5 wins 5th place and achieves well-matched results with 1st place model (AP 39.43\%). Compared to baseline model (YOLOv5), TPH-YOLOv5 improves about 7\%, which is encouraging and competitive.},

  abstract = {Object detection, as of one the most fundamental and challenging problems in computer vision, has received great attention in recent years. Its development in the past two decades can be regarded as an epitome of computer vision history. If we think of today's object detection as a technical aesthetics under the power of deep learning, then turning back the clock 20 years we would witness the wisdom of cold weapon era. This paper extensively reviews 400+ papers of object detection in the light of its technical evolution, spanning over a quarter-century's time (from the 1990s to 2019). A number of topics have been covered in this paper, including the milestone detectors in history, detection datasets, metrics, fundamental building blocks of the detection system, speed up techniques, and the recent state of the art detection methods. This paper also reviews some important detection applications, such as pedestrian detection, face detection, text detection, etc, and makes an in-deep analysis of their challenges as well as technical improvements in recent years.},
